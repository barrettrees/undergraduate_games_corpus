        "title": "Snowfall",
        "description": "Snowfall was designed as a simple variation on the platformer genre, wherein you play a snowflake falling through the air trying to avoid dangers such as icicles and fiery snowflakes. In the game, snow-covered wooden platforms are generated at uneven time intervals and travel across the screen. These platforms can hinder or help the player, depending on how the player jumps or slides to stay within the screen.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\nThe thematic material is light and fun, which is reflected in the up-beat, slightly-stressful music we selected. Although you play cute snowflake, there is still some element of stress in trying to avoid enemies and achieve as high a score as possible. Visually, we leaned into the lightheartedness of the game to present a very soft, bright looking game. The snowflake changes color depending on which power-ups are attained, and the cheery feel is amplified through soft sounds such as snow softly crunching when you land on a platform, or fire cracking softly when a fiery snowflake falls.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\nThough Snowfall follows the mechanical conventions of many other simple games such as Doodle Jump, it differs in that the player must gain skill in using the controls to dodge falling obstacles in addition to falling onto new platforms. Risk is rewarded because power-ups are randomly generated, and intentionally do not always pop up in places where they are easy to get. In this way, Snowfall differs from traditional platformers because it often must be played riskily to achieve high scores, and it can take quite a few games to get good enough at dodging to embrace such risks.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\nIn creating this game, teamwork was key and is the first class concept that I would like to discuss. From the beginning, my partner and I took to a procedure where we worked a lot together, divided up the remaining tasks fairly, and then worked independently. This process led us to be successful as a team because both of us were equally skilled in creating mechanics and assets in Construct, so we were able to work cohesively at debugging and overall tuning very nicely. Though the lectures emphasized having distinct roles, we found that our emphasis on communication\u00e2\u0080\u0094both in person and via Google Docs\u00e2\u0080\u0094allowed us to have flexible roles without the misunderstandings. This was truly one of the best team experiences I have ever had, and I feel that getting to experience it while also learning a bit about effective team strategies really solidified the content for me.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\nAs for the game itself, Snowfall engages the concept of behavioral conditioning because it is a bit addictive. By making having quick transitions between gameplay and the final score screen, we used operant conditioning to improve the likelihood that the player will play multiple times in a row. It is very likely that the player will die relatively quickly the first time they play the game because it takes time to learn controls well. Subsequently after losing, the player sees large letters suggesting that they play again. It makes sense that the player would choose to play again, because there is an appeal to their inner achiever\u00e2\u0080\u0094through displaying their score\u00e2\u0080\u0094to improve and get a higher score! The controls are intuitive enough that it only takes a couple of tries before the player can get significantly higher scores. Thus, we have eased them into a cycle wherein they play the game repeatedly. In all honesty, we were not thinking about this cycle at all when my partner and I came up with the game. However, the course material has revealed how the simple suggestions (having a score and replay button) have an effect on what people tend to do, and how game designers must be mindful of using these suggestions for good and to create a good experience for players.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\nAs a last thought, playtesting was an exceptionally valuable part of this game making-process. Playtesters helped to show us that we needed a more challenging, dynamic game\u00e2\u0080\u0094from the perspective of controls\u00e2\u0080\u0094but they also taught us a ton about clearly conveying cause and effect situations. When we created our power-ups, we thought that it would be clear what each one did, but players only saw a snowflake changing color. This forced us to try a wide variety of different animations, effects, and eventually sounds to communicate what was going on. Player feedback was the only way that we could find out if we were communicating clearly or not, and this ultimately improved our game.",

I added a story to hell if the quiz was wrong, a story to heaven if it was right, and put the ending that the user was curious about.\n\nI also received the following feedback from users in the alpha version of the test.\n- There is no image in the game.\n- I want you to visually show the animals.\n- I want to have an image of the animal when the results for the soulmate come out.\n- I wish there was an ending to Good Place or Bad Place.\nI have satisfied all of the above in the beta version.\n\nMy game allows younger children to study animals.\nIn fact, I also looked at a lot of wikis while creating the game and tried to include as many of the features of the animal classifications as possible in the game.\nThe educational use of games is my goal.",

You begin in a hospital, being told you're dying, and throughout the majority of the game slip in and out of memories from the past that give insight into your downward spiral. However, all is not so bad, as if you make the choices that open up discussion and the opportunity to accept love, as well as really explore the world, you may just find your way out of the destructive cycle and into the true, happy ending.\nTwo Endings.",

        "title": "Trafficking",
        "description": "I chose the theme traffic. I use this word in the most obvious sense of like car traffic in some of the memory flashbacks but I mostly use the other definition of traffic as in trafficking illegal goods, in this case endangered species. I wanted my game to have lots of possible paths that are somewhat determined by the player and somewhat determined by chance, just like life. So I used random functions here and there as well as choices. I also wanted to provide more background for players who like to go more in depth while offering the option to skip past the background/detail-y stuff so I set up stretch-text type descriptions which, in addition to providing more description of objects and surroundings in the game world, internally set up the opportunity to randomly get a flashback in a later passage. I hoped that players who wanted more information would get a more vivid image of the world and get a back story about the character's past as a normal kid wanting adventure and magic, a background unavailable to players who didn't look closely at things. In the background/flashback material I wanted to show a character longing for this fantasy adventure that they've read about and then in the present-trafficking world they are in a world of adventure and fantastical creatures. Are they dreaming? Are they dead? Are they really in the fantasy world? What, if anything, is real here? I hoped these questions might come up for some players.",

        "title": "ROAD RAGE: DEER!!!",
        "description": "Our game, ROAD RAGE: DEER!!!, is a simple game in which the player can control a deer running on a highway. Your only goal is to dodge the vehicles coming to you from the top of the screen. The further you go along the road, the higher the score will be. The goal for this game, as of the goal for any games, is to make the player feel fun. In doing that, we made the game simple in its form and control but challenging. The player experience is a core to make a good game, as we talked in class. Thus this game is designed in such a way that one can play during one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s short spared time, for example, when having a noon break at work. For gameplay, we made the game to have a third-person fixed camera view from above. In such a way you can pay attention to the vehicles from above while controlling the deer, and make early decisions to doge in certain directions before the vehicles got near to the deer. The game control is very simple, you can just move the deer left or right in a fixed speed, yet to make it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s simple but challenging and fun, we made a bunch of different types of vehicles with different speed depending on their type, some of them also have accelerations, which means they can get faster and faster over time, making the game more challenging over time. For example, the race car in the game has a big acceleration, but it also appears on the screen less frequently than other vehicles. To make it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s challenging and at the same time playable, we added a sound effect for the race car. So every time it comes out you can hear a warning and the sound of speed up can make the player more excited. For the art style, we choose 2D pixel style. This art style not just because it keeps the game simple and intuitive, but also makes the game less realistic. In such a way when the deer explodes when hit a car, people would feel less uncomfortable compared to seeing an actual deer die.\n\nAnother class concepts we engaged in our game is about choosing art style: the level of abstract. In the class, we talked about how the level of abstract of the characters can affect the feeling of the player. The more abstract the expression is in art style, the more strong the emotion and be demonstrated, and make the player substitute more into the game. When we are deciding what art style to use, as I talked in the first part of this essay, we are thinking about what it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s level of abstract should be. One crucial reason we choose 2D pixel is that its an abstract style, and this style can greatly reduce the realistic of the characters: deer, cars, and explosions, while demonstrating the part we want. If we make the deer very like a real one, then it might be very violent when it hit a car and explode. But by making it pixel-like, we emphasized the explosion and running of the deer, and decreased the violence level.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nThis game was originally inspired by the chrome dinosaur game, in which you can control a dinosaur and jump to dodge the obstacles, the scoring system for our game is similar to that of the chrome game. Yet the innovation of our game is found in making the player view from above, make the obstacles coming to you instead of moving to obstacles, and instead of jumping to dodge using moving to dodge. A funny video found online about a lost deer running in a city in Japan and jumped over the fence and fall into a river also inspired us. The topic of the game is about deer and traffic, which perfectly combined two of the keywords for this project. We innovatively made the different types of vehicles in this game to have different features in speed, making such a looping game less repeating. Also, our game has an explosion effect for the deer when it hits a car instead of the flicker effect for most similar games like Floppy Bird; and the present of pixel art style with simple animations makes the game cute and energetic(Just like its name!).\u00c2\u00a0 Those are the futures you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find in other games.\n\nI asked three of my friends playtest this game. Two of them, without much game-playing experience, found it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too hard to play at the beginning. I found out it probably because the starting position of the deer is facing the starting position of the race car, the fastest car in this game. So we changed the starting position of the deer and cars a little bit to make it easier to start with. After this change two of the playtesters feel its a funny and challenging game, but one of them still feels it's too hard. One of the reason might be he was playing with a phone and the control by touching the screen is not very good, due to the size of the game viewport. But all of them do like the music and sound effect of the game and told me its very suitable for such a highway-dodging game.",

        "description": "The Collector is a 2D movement-based platformer with only 1 level. The player starts off with little information of their movement controls other than the basic up/down left/right. As the player progresses, they begin to learn more skills which can now be used upon when the player resets. Chimes are a core mechanic in the game as it can be used as a powerup or as health. The game ends once the player runs out of chimes so management of resources is also a core aspect of the game.",

I also wanted there to be multiple ways to win / lose depending on how you proceed through the game. You can make a bunch of correct decisions then go back to your old life, causing the story to restart. Some decisions are forced, some will cause you to win/ lose immediately, some will simply allow the game to proceed. I tried to further emphasize these different linking ideologies by reworking the text. Additionally, the difficulty selector can transport you to a winning scenario, a neutral scenario, or a losing scenario depending on the player's selection, an additional form of story linking that provides a more complete overview of the story for the user.",

        "title": "Witch_vs_Deer (Ver4.5)",
        "description": "Jun Hee Heo: Our game\u00e2\u0080\u0099s title is \u00e2\u0080\u009cWitch vs. Deer\u00e2\u0080\u009d. It is a 2 player PvP game, using mouse and keyboard. We wanted to make a simple and easy game that takes only few minutes. The background story of our game is: \u00e2\u0080\u009cOnce upon a time, there were deers living in a forest. One day, pandemic hit the deer group and the only cure is the magic apple. The deer who brings the apple would be the leader of the group. A deer decided to go to get the magic apple. However, to get the apple, he should fight the witch. The witch, who lived peacefully inside the forest, was suffering because of the noise made by deer groups. And what? A deer is going to steal my magic apple? That could not be happen!\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOur game is a 2D game. There is a title page written \u00e2\u0080\u009cWitch vs. Deer\u00e2\u0080\u009d and if you click \u00e2\u0080\u0098play\u00e2\u0080\u0099 button below the title, there will be a short introduction about the game\u00e2\u0080\u0099s story. After few seconds, the screen will move to the \u00e2\u0080\u0098game play\u00e2\u0080\u0099 screen. One person will be the defender and other will be the attacker. Attacker is at the top and defender is located at the bottom. The players only move horizontally and the items only move vertically. The attacker (witch), throw magics down in a certain frequency. The attacker can control the witch with mouse. The witch will follow the mouse only moving right and left. Also, witch has a skill which has a cool time of 9 seconds. If the witch is prepared to use the skill, witch will turn into pink and attacker can shoot pink laser by clicking left mouse. Witch will win when she success attacking the deer. The defender (deer) need to dodge from the magic and laser, and get enough number of magic apples. The deer can move using left and right arrow keys. The magic apples will fall down once in 5 seconds randomly. Also, there is a shield item that falls down randomly. If deer gets shield, he will be invincible for few seconds. Deer will gain victory if he earns 5 apples.\n\nThe class concepts used for this game is \u00e2\u0080\u009cdeer\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cfalling\u00e2\u0080\u009d. As described at the background story of the game, one of the players will be a deer. We chose this concept because the idea came right into our brain when we knew one of the concepts was deer. Also, I wanted to draw a deer for our game too. Magic apple falls down from the top. Falling is an important component because it is one of the rules in the gameplay. Falling objects work as vertical movements and players make horizontal movements. The control innovates our game. Our game is a PvP game which one player control with mouse and other player control with keyboard. Other PvP games usually use only keyboard or mouse or have turns if they use both. However, our game uses both mouse and keyboards. Also, the players do not compete with same rules, but each character has different rules of winning, skill, and items. That is, most of the players of our games will try to play the game at least twice. Also, we have a fairytale like background story too. The images from the game is all made by us too. The idea was from \u00e2\u0080\u009cGallag\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cPong\u00e2\u0080\u009d. At \u00e2\u0080\u009cGallag\u00e2\u0080\u009d, the player shoots missiles constantly and \u00e2\u0080\u009cPong\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a 2 player game which the players can move only horizontally. The game is not so innovative technically compared with other games because we had lack of time.After feedbacks from TA and friend\u00e2\u0080\u0099s playtesting, we fixed some parts of the game and added new things. There was a feedback that witch wins almost every time because the witch had way more faster speed. We adjusted the speed of the witch and deer. Also the acceleration of deer changed because the witch had fast speed and the deer became too slow when he changed the direction. The collision was strange when the deer collided with the apple. It changed direction strangely. We solved that problem also. There were some feedbacks which the game was too much simple, so we added new skill for the witch and items for the deer.\n\nChangwan ParK: First, the game story. You are a happy dear living with other happy dears. Dears live together and made a dear village. However, the witch does not like the dear because they are so happy. The witch crafted some pandemic, and made it hit the dear party. Now almost every deer is dying, and you became a dear scientist and work on finding the cure. You found out that the only cure is the apple, which can be looted at the witch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house. If you get the cure, you will be the leader of the group, and deer will thrive. If not, there will be deer left on earth. You attack the witch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s house to collect the apples for rescuing the deer village.Next, the gameplay. There are two players in the game, and the game has two rounds. At each round, two players are assigned to attacker and defender. Defender's character is deer, and can move the character left and right by pressing left and right keys on keyboard. There are two items for the defender. First item is the shield. It will fall vertically towards the defender. This will make the defender invincible for 4.5 seconds. The second item is apple. The defender's goal is to collect 5 apples. After collecting those, defender wins and becomes a deer leader. If defender overlaps with enemies (green asterisk shaped thing), the attacker wins unless the defender has the shield activated. Attacker's character is witch. Attacker can move the character left and right by moving mouse curser left and right way. There are no items for witch, but enemies will automatically spawn at the attacker's position, having constant horizontal velocity, falling towards defender. The attacker's goal is to control its position, make the enemies hit the defender. Attacker has a special ability to shoot purple laser, which has bigger collision box and high speed, likely to hit the defender. Attacker's special ability has a 9 second of cool time, and it can be activated by pressing left click. The attacker's win condition is to kill defender before defender collects five apples.Third, the aesthetic goals of our game. Actually the plot is pretty weak. Why the which hates the happy deer? But still, I can argue that there are some awkward people who does not like other people happy in real life. They spread inappropriate ideas to nearby people and contaminate the gloomy feeling. These are the witches. In contrast, all the happy people, who runs the society, can be referred to the deer. Deer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goal is not just steal an apple and cure the world, but first to get near to damaged soul of witches. Apples are set to represent all the bad ideas that witches have, and neutralize it by using happiness of dear.The game is designed as 2D. I will claim that the game has the third person view, since the attacker and the defender can view themselves and the opponent. If the game was designed in the first person view, All the views will be in one dimensional shape, since the total game is in 2D. Therefore, players would not be able to distinguish apples from enemies and shield, and even the game character. By using third person view for designing our game, the players can learn the opponent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movement and will try to enhance the winning rate, by becoming more successful in dodging the enemies, or getting better in triggering collisions between the defender and the enemy.Frankly, I do not think the game is super innovative compared with other games. We had a lack of time, and rushed to make the game playable. However, we can polish our project goals, which was heavily discussed in the third paragraph. Redesign of the images or even reconstructing the game in 3D might be helpful for being innovative compared to other games. I meant that the game is distinguishable by the intention of the game.The playtesting part was quite interesting. TA gave us some strong feedbacks, which gave us lots of insight. Actually, we have never playtested our game when we submitted the alpha version. In consequence, as the TA said, the witch won every time. Therefore, we have adjusted the values of the speed of the defender and the attacker. The actual speed values were decided by multiple playtesting. Also, the collision was really weird, so we tweaked the collision box in order to make the gameplay not wanky but smooth. Without the constructive feedback, our game may have led to super boring, trivial game.",

        "title": "Peach Girl",
        "description": "Speaking of the aesthetic goals, we wanted the player to have a fantasy and challenging experience overall. In ancient Japan, a girl named the Peach Girl, who was born in a peach, began her adventure because the evil boss Oni took away her soulmate the Peach Boy. In the game, as the Peach Girl, the player goes on a journey to save Peach Boy. Along her adventure, the Peach girl will encounter a huge number of monsters with different kinds: red-faced Oni attacks you with a wooden club, whereas the blue-faced monster throws stones to damage her. The game loop is perhaps that the player fights the monsters, to get stronger, and stay alive to fight more monsters. In this way, the player would be well-prepared to defeat the final boss. The boss Oni has binary attacking model throw a fireball when the player is far from it or hits the Peach Girl with the mace when being near her. However, the player will find it more difficult to kill the boss Oni than normal monsters, as that is our goal to bring the challenging experience for the player. Therefore, when you kill the boss Oni, you can save the Peach Boy.\n\nOur gameplay goal that makes the players interacting with game mechanics is by clear visual representation on the game. As a result, when creating this game, we focused not only on game logics but also on our artwork. We drew all the characters, animations, and assets except for the boss in the game. Also, we gave each character several animations, such as walking, jumping, attacking, all of which we drew. The other reason why we drew all of these is that characters online could not match our initial intention. In the end, we choose pix art as our drawing style since, based on the lecture, the less detail gives the player more space for imagination. Also, by referring to the class, we used what we learned from the lecture to balance the \u00e2\u0080\u009cstory\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cmechanics\u00e2\u0080\u009d. We wanted to make the Peach Girl and the Peach Boy and monster with an ancient oriental feel to make the storyline interesting. Therefore, we chose an ancient Asian style background and there. Also, we made the boss other monsters have similar shapes but different sizes to distinguish them and made normal monsters to have the same shapes but different colors. In doing so, we pursued unity and diversity at the same time for the game.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0Like the mechanics that many other games shared, the Peach Girl can walk (left arrow, right arrow buttons), run (up arrow button), attack (z-button), and dodge (x-button). The Peach Girl can reduce her damage according to her defense power and cause damage to the monsters based on her attack power. Based on what we talked about in the class, we could not affect the player experience directly but by manipulating the mechanics, so that is the reason we added fun mechanics to make the game experience better. Also, from the feedback from playtesting by other peers, we modified our game in several ways. First of all, we allowed the Peach Girl to dodge can avoid incoming attacks by pressing x-button and made the player action (walking, attacking, and jumping) much smoother. Besides, by adding multiple rooms, we have \u00e2\u0080\u009chyperlinks\u00e2\u0080\u009d that discussed in lecture. Moreover, we originally had only one type of monster, but we made two types of monsters with the action of hitting with the club and throwing the stone, respectively to make the game better. Also, we added a wall to prevent the player from falling off the edge. In the past, when the user makes the decision, the monster didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop the attack. We heard peers said that this prevented users from making a choice, so we updated the monsters to let the users pause for a while until they made a choice. The most important mechanics we added is the feedback for the player to notice the damage. By implementing these mechanics, the player would know when they are being hurt by the other monsters.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\nUnlike other Action games that use player\u00e2\u0080\u0099s EXP for levelling up, what makes our game innovative is the sacrificing/saving mechanics: the player can have a chance to make a moral decision whether to sacrifice or save the monster after killing it, to make the Peach Girl stronger. This decision affects the player\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attack or defense power. Also, this score determines how much the player will be attacked and attacked. In ordinary games, these scores change. Therefore, it might take quite a while for players to feel the change on their stats.",

        "title": "Soulbind",
        "description": "Soulbind is an action puzzle platformer in which you must control both the body and the spirit to work together to kill demons and collect souls. The end product met the goals of the project, but have evolved overtime. Soulbind was first thought of through controls. It started with the idea of controlling two characters, one with WASD and one with the mouse, that need to be simultaneously used. Eventually, both top-down and bottom-up design processes were used to inform mechanics and aesthetics. From the controls a series of branching questions arose. The movement mechanics we chose were ones that made the most intuitive sense which, in turn informed us on what the camera and characters would be like. The WASD character would be a familiar platformer while the mouse character would become the cursor. The camera became the boundaries of where the spirit could go. In turn, the body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movement was limited in that it could only jump through the spirit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pulse. To further force the character to work together, their abilities were made interdependent. The body has the unique ability of being able to kill the monster and collect the souls while the spirit has the unique ability of getting the body to those goals or vice versa. Both characters are meant to be symbiotic.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nAn entities\u00e2\u0080\u0099 body and soul along with the soulmate the word inspired the top-down design of the game. Such goulish characters should exist in a dark environment such as a cursed cave full of demons. Collecting souls became the focus of the game since it fit the needs of progression and aesthetic cohesiveness. In addition, it gave meaning behind the characters actions on multiple levels. The souls were going to be used as goals for both body and spirit through story and gameplay. To create more emotional investment, souls are needed for the reunification of the body and spirit. Killing enemies became part of the conversation loop. Enemies would drop souls upon death that would allow the player to progress in the game so that players can gather more souls. The dark, mysterious, unholy aesthetic branched from the idea of controlling a spiritless body and lost spirit. A dark cavern was made and classic vile enemies were used. Mysterious, purple tips fade in and eerily blue particles aimlessly float and dissipate. The contrast between the blue soul energy of the characters and the maroon of the environment and enemies is meant to highlight the characters and the connection between them.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nThe game idea was inspired by several other games in which players control two characters, namely, Super Mario Galaxy, The Last Guardian, a few of the Super Smash Brothers characters, and Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. The main inspiration, Brothers, was a game in which players would control two brothers individually through the two thumbsticks on a controller to solve puzzles. The older brother is stronger and can move objects while the younger brother is smaller and can fit through narrow passages. Soulbind was inspired by the idea of controlling two characters who have different strengths and must work together. Our game is different in the fact it uses the 2D side scrolling action genre to build the characters. Many of the games I listed and others that involve controlling more than one character often don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t allow individual control of both, one of them is more powerful than the other, or they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have simultaneously work together. Our goal was to create a game where you cannot simply switch between two characters for certain circumstances just as body and spirit should work together in tandem. Unfortunately, this goal already inherently makes the game difficult, and we found it implement it without handicapping each character and making the other characters fill in the gap. Each character, in turn, feel worse to play as individually which put off me and playtesters who repeated controlled one character at a time.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nDuring playtesting, I had the chance to employ some of the game design skills I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve learned. To encourage using both characters the game has parts where only one character can complete a task and others where using both would be it must easier. It was our hope that mainly the difficulty would force players to use both characters at the same time, but I saw that playtesters would only pay attention to one character at a time. As a result, they wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how they took damage and got overwhelmed by rooms I thought weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as hard as they made them seem. Since we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have much time left, we added more visual feedback for taking damage and reduced some enemy variables. Particles spew out of the recently hurt character and the screen becomes darker based on the player\u00e2\u0080\u0099s missing health. It seemed to be the simplest solution, but it didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t solve the crux of the problem. A player could in fact using one character at a time to beat the game although it would be very difficult. From the playtesting, we realized the game could fit a midpoint as a goal: to have two characters players must switch between quickly to accomplish tasks. On the other hand, perhaps the game could be played, and perhaps developed, more as a strategic game.\u00c2\u00a0",

        "title": "Rainy Deer",
        "description": "This is Mt. Vesuvius in Italy. One day, Mount Vesuvius, who thought it was a dormant volcano, suddenly began to explode. The mountain was accompanied by a huge earthquake and volcanic ash. Many of the animals and plants in the mountain were blown away by the explosion. In particular, there were many deer on Mount Vesuvius, many of which fell from the sky. Among the drops were a mix of leaves and shoes as well as deer. At the time of the eruption, a woodcutter remained unable to escape the eruption at Vesuvius. He had to avoid the rain of deer falling from the sky..\n\nWhen the game starts, you can see the setting of moon night. In here, press the 'r' key on the initial page. The background music of the early pages begins after a brief rainstorm. The sound of the rain was put in because our game name is Rainy Deer. When the game starts, the time of survival and the number of lives remaining are marked on the left end. If you get hit by a deer, the number of lives decreases. Deer drops more and more quickly over time goes by. The goal of the game is to survive the falling deer.There are three items that help you survive. Heart increases the number of lives. Shoes increases the speed of the player. Leaves makes slow down the deer. Three items fall at once at the start of the game. You have to carefully choose what to eat as an initial item. After that, each item falls into a random position on a different time basis. Player should be careful not to incur the deer while eating the item. When the game is over, you can see the time you recorded. If you press the 'r' key once more on the ending page, you can play it again.\n\nWhen designing the game, I was inspired by the \"Dung-Boo Game,\" which I often played as a child. Games like this are a form of game that you can often see when web games developed in the past. Nevertheless, what's unique about our games is that they can create dynamic cases, not just fall.\n\nThe deer's speed is getting faster. Deer grows gradually every second. The amount falling also increases. Deer can control the amount of drop as an item. Games like this used to be one life, but we provide players with many lives. They can also fill their lives through items. The speed of the player can also be adjusted as an item. By adding multiple items to the existing game format, people often die trying to eat items. This situation increases the fear of avoiding deer falling from the top.\n\nThis type of game usually uses a lot of cute images, where deer fall and bleed. This effect has increased the tension of the game. It also caused the blood to remain so, requiring more concentration to avoid the deer that continued to fall.\n\nWhen people played an alpha version of the game, the feedback we received most was that players didn't know whether they were hit by a deer or not. To solve this problem, we added a sound that matches an object that fits when the player is hit by a deer. TA got feedback asking us to add background music. I picked two pieces of music that fit our situation from my usual favorite game, Maple Story background music, and added music that my team mate liked to set up as starting music, game-going music and ending music. TA also advised that the deer's blood should not be removed quickly, but left to remain, giving it a grotteptic look. We deeply sympathized with this feedback and adjusted the options so that the deer remained in the dead position.\n\nI made a game for the first time in my life. By making this game, I realized how complicated the game I play is to make. Thinking that every move of the player was coded, I realized why the game company needed so many developers. As I thought that the game company made all the resources necessary for the game, designers and musicians belonging to the game production company respected me. Especially, for music, it is not easy to be inspired and you have to create different music from map to map. The music also has to go well with the artistic part of the game. Therefore, game companies should make efforts outside of game production, such as having to adjust each department's schedule well. Recognizing this process, I thought that all the resources that I could see in the game were made for this game, and I thought it was not a game I used to play.

Almost three months ago, the Blizzard uploaded the workshop to the Over watch,\u00c2\u00a0 so players can make their game mode in their way with some logical setup. Firstly, I want to use create a 2-D shoot game in the horizontal view of Overwatch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s map, so I go to the Chinese Overwatch community to ask whether we can use workshop option to view Overwatch gameplay in 2 dimensions. Then, several players talk to me and we decide to make it possible, which it finally works and very cool. Therefore, based on the workshop I create, I get the picture of ground and characters. The goal of my game is protection. The player as soldier-76 need to protect his \u00e2\u0080\u009csoul mate\u00e2\u0080\u009d Hanzo from the doomfists\u00e2\u0080\u0099, enemy, attack in one mintue.\n\nActually, Overwatch is a first-person-shooter game in 3 dimensions, but how about we view it in different perceptive?

        "description": "When I was young in elementary school and middle school, I did not have an iPhone or Android phone to play some well-developed games. I can only play games on Nokia phones ported over from IOS or Android. Also, I did have an FC to play some old pixel games. Among all of those games, I spend most of my time on Doodle Jump and Super Mario, which is the thesis of my graphical game. With an extended game time, I could reach the score which most people were not able to get. Therefore, in my game, I intended to make it more complicated than the original Doodle Jump with monsters from Super Mario.\n\nSince it is the first graphic game I developed, I tried to make it an advanced version of Doodle Jump. In this case, This game still based on low-pixel icons and graphs. However, I added some monsters to make it more difficult. Like the original version of Doodle Jump, I have three types of jumping pads: the black one which you can jump on it for countless times, green one which will disappear one second after you jump on it, and the red one which will move left and right on the screen. Also, I tried to apply the monster in Mario to my game: the turtle with thorn on its back. If the player collides with the turtle when he or she is falling, the game will end. However, the player can shoot the bullet horizontally to eliminate the monster and thus jump on the pads safely.\n\nIn class, we discussed the concepts, including falling. I think falling is the central concept I applied in this game because it is one of the failure conditions. Since I have previous programming experience until CMPS 101, I decided to let my character jump to negative Y-axis. As the screen scrolls, it will spawn more pads for the player to jump. Likewise, the pads below the screen will be destroyed. Therefore, once the player falls below the screen, he or she will fail the game.\n\nComparing to the original Doodle Jump which I played before, I added bullets and monsters to it. The Doodle Jump which I played years ago was the oldest one. It had only three kinds of jumping pads and springs only. So I decided to add more things to it. I have not found out that there were lots of version of Doodle Jump in recent years until I was developing the beta version of this game. Some of them had skyrockets; some of them allowed you to kill the monsters above by shooting bullets to them vertically. Those game are not my goals since I have never played them. I only built my own jumping game on the oldest Doodle Jump.\n\nMy design of Doodle Jump was to make it painful. In the past four months, I was deeply addicted to an ultimately hard game called Sekiro. It was a game which required the player to concentrate on the attacking movements of monsters. Moreover, for different monsters, their attacking actions were totally different, which means the players have to spend time to get familiar with monsters movements. I spent twenty-six hours on my first clearance, and now I just finished the eighth clearance with the most challenging mode. Therefore, I tried to make my jumping game hard to play: although it will not be as challenging as Sekiro, the players might fail if they did not pay attention to my game. The normal Doodle Jump has lots of pads for the players to jump. In this case, failing is much more complicated than jumping upwards. On the IOS version, the players control the character in the game by slanting their phones. If you tilt your phone to make the screen perpendicular to the ground, the speed of the character will reach its maximum. I tried to play Doodle Jump on my phone in this way and did not fail for five minutes. As a result, such a thing will never happen in my game.\n\nAfter playtesting, the results showed that my design of difficulty was too harsh to play. The jump strength and the distance between two pads will make the player feel very tight. Therefore, I just decreased such length to make it feel better. The alpha version of my game was a rough outline only. So I believe that the beta version will be much more fun since it has more components.\n\nThere are still some bugs I cannot solve. As for the red moving pads, if there are multiple red pads on the screen, whichever reaches the left or right side of the screen will cause all of them to move to their opposite direction. Additionally, I disabled the collision of the character when it is jumping and re-enable it when the character is falling. If the character reaches its maximum height of a jump but cannot jump to another pad, it will be stuck a little bit. Those are two known bugs but not fatal to the entire game.",

        "title": "Graphical Fall",
        "description": "The aesthetic goal of my game is to make a game that incorporates the theme word of falling by invoking an angel falling from heaven to the earth. During this fall, the forces of heaven are chasing you, creating the beams of light that you are to dodge during the game. At the end of the game, the angel player character has become a fallen angel, with black feathers and a darker coloring, further incorporating the theme word of falling. The end shows that the player character made it to the surface of the earth. The gameplay of dodging is intended to invoke a frantic escape, and the attacks ramp up as you get farther and farther away before waning again as you get beyond your enemies' reaches. The lack of an attack on your side is to emphasize that you are more escaping and running away than fighting, as you can't fight back against that kind of enemy. The mouse controls help portray the player character as fast and nimble.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nThe gameplay goal is to have a bullet-hell type of game that focuses on dodging more than anything else. The controls are mouse rather than keyboard, like wasd or arrow keys, as it allows for faster movement with more control. This makes the game easier, as you can move to where you need to go in less time, so you have more time to react to what you see on the screen.\u00c2\u00a0 You can also better correct for movement that is too slow or when you move the mouse too far with a rapid mouse flick. You should be able to read the safe areas and move to safety on reaction, and you should not need to memorize any sequences.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nThe game is unlike many bullet hells in that there is no enemy to shoot. It is unlike games like Phoenix 2, where you are both dodging shots and firing at enemies. It splits your attention and makes both actions harder to perform.\u00c2\u00a0\n\n\u00c2\u00a0",

        "title": "Grow!",
        "description": "\u00c2\u00a0Grow! is a game where player gets to enjoy in the perspective of grass, an object which is though to have passive stance in daily lives. Its' main aesthetic is to tweak norms of puzzle game just a little bit to let users enjoy a new sense of fun from it.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0Grow! is no different from usual puzzle games, except for the fact that it has always more than 2 protagonists running at the same time. The items, such as holes and soil, and the enemies, represented as deer, are so common features of normal puzzle games. I wanted user to have a fresh experience, but not a strange experience where everything is new with never exited rules of chaos. I was astonished by the game \"Yami\" (from the last semester) and \"Baba is You\" and learned how important it is to think out of box when making games. The \"multiple protagonist\" concept is the answer I came up with, and I've figured out that it was pretty successful while play testing the game.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0Grow! has another core concept. Grass merges. Grass grows in 4 steps in the overall game. They are able to do different things when they have grown to certain level. On the design stage, I wanted to make a game where players could feel the distinctive difference in available options they could make according to the different states of grass, but due to time limitations and 45 event limitations I ended up having just one effect where grass grows to state 3, the sand on the map is broken.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0Grow! takes a lot of concepts learned from class active. The mechanics are simple, making 80 pixels of move works fairly for all objects in the game. Everything is under control and rules, you don't have to worry about objects or deer sliding down in different speeds with their own positions. It is relatively easy and intuitive to learn, easy to control yet has variety of options that we could make the game through.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0\"Cool!\" was one of the most frequent comment I've heard while play testing this game. It was for sure, had independent logic and feature among the games made this semester. I've played all the Construct games from last semester posted on board. Some of them were normal, some of them were fun, and some of them were astonishing. It was not only the effort they've put into the game that surprised me, but also how much they have thought about the game itself, really surprised me. For instance, \"Yami\" had its unique feature of turning the light off, making the game a totally different from usual Mario games. Although the idea itself might sound simple, it is never easy to come up with a brilliant idea like that. I've spent a lot of time, focusing on what could be distinctive in our games that would be fresh and unique. I've came up with an idea of Maze Sprinter first, where acceleration matters in a maze game, protagonist could break the wall if they have enough speed, but due to logical issues (both programming logic and gaming logic) I've discarded the idea.\n\n\u00c2\u00a030 seconds describable and 15 minutes playable are difficult conditions to match. This literally means that your game should be simple but fun. You really need a sparking idea to achieve those goals. Therefore I was proud, since people really enjoyed playing the last 2 stages of Grow! The average time taken for people to play Grow! was 10 mins, and the worst case (who had no previous experience in playing games) took 17 mins to complete. Even for the game lovers, it took 6 mins to clear the game. Considering the fact that the game could be physically cleared in a minute and a half if played perfectly, we could assure that there is a challenge which players had to overcome, eventually generating fun and continuous retries.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0Developing Grow! would be an unforgettable experience. I've achieved confidence in making games or logic that people could actually enjoy and be engaged in. I've got a sense of developer's perspective, which was totally different from that of a normal player. In my future life, both as a player and as a developer, this experience would help in understanding and exploring games for more good. I would like to thank Tad and hard working TAs for introducing a wonderful chance to have the game developed, tested and published with evaluation.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0The soul of Grow! will grow on, even after all class schedules are over.",

        "description": "** Game starts on Layout 2 **\nMy game is meant to play off the idea that the player is some celebrity/notable person trying to get ready for an event while dodging photographers. Aesthetically, I used a lot of light blues in the initial screens. I wanted the main layout to look like a third person, somewhat bird\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye view of a salon or special dressing venue. I wanted there to be individual rooms and floors that could indicate to players that something of value would be in each room. I wanted gameplay to be relatively challenging with lasting tension. I would say the main theme of gameplay would be user learning. I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t played many games, but I went for a smoother look for the sprite\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as opposed to the more pixelated objects that seem to be really common among construct 3 games.\n\nThe game engages class concepts by maintaining a certain level of suspense for the player and includes a brief instruction set. I designed the game in a way such that it would take the player a few tries to figure out how to successfully retrieve objects without colliding with a photographer. This promotes user learning as well as suspense as they get farther and farther, then set back if they fail to pick up on patterns quick enough. While my game doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t include multiple levels, the difficulty is meant to increase as the player advances, as they have to keep track of more and more enemy movement patterns. A lot of the time, enemies were off screen, so the player needs to mentally time their movements and keep track of which ones are fast vs. slow. The player needs to do this all while finding safe zones--i.e. Places where enemies won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reach in order to observe their surroundings and calculate their next move.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nAs for instructions, I was inspired by Florence\u00e2\u0080\u0099s minimal instruction set. While my game doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t involve nearly as much story line and is more play-based, I tried to incorporate some direction, while letting the player figure out for the most part what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re supposed to do. I felt that for Florence it added not only an interesting stylistic element, but also allows for a heightened player learning experience. Given the design of the game, the player doesn't really have much autonomy over what they do because the game has a specific strategy. However, I feel like the beginning instruction layouts make them feel as though they somehow had some time for exploration/ understanding the character.\n\nI tried to be somewhat innovative by basing gameplay on multiple actions: finding objects, identifying their order, and avoiding enemies. I find that most 2D games, like candy crush, are based on one action or motive like connecting similar looking candies. However, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve only played 2 online games outside of class in my life-- the Sims 3 and some other game similar to it-- so I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if I just lack exposure to other games. (Florence was the first game I ever downloaded from the app store.) I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to think the game is also innovative in that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very simple, yet requires a lot of tries to determine patterns/ what to do.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nDuring play testing I was mainly told that the game was too hard and it was making people angry. Without realizing it, the first playable version of my game was pretty much impossible to win. The enemies moved too fast, while the player was too slow. Thus, it was really difficult for players to outrun enemies or really explore the map without running into trouble. This is obviously bad because, while I intended to game to elicit some anxiety, it mainly caused annoyance. This made other aspects of the game frustrating, because moving around the map was basically impossible. The game is largely based off the player navigating the map. Thus, whenever a player would find an object, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d often discover it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the correct one, so they\u00e2\u0080\u0099d have to find their way to a new one, which was apparently super frustrating, given it was hard to move anywhere. I addressed this by slowing down some of the enemies and speeding up the player. I found that a good solution was to create variety in the speeds of the enemies, as it added to the learning curve while also increasing the difficulty as the game progressed. I was also told that at first the character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s movements were weird (they would go upside down), so I fixed that.\u00c2\u00a0",

        "description": "Judy Yu and I wanted to create a game that was happy, pretty, and fun to play. I wanted to avoid feelings of darkness, horror, and suspense and the mechanisms of shooters and platformers that I saw in other Construct 3 games. We came up with the falling words mechanism idea pretty early on to incorporate the theme of falling and we wanted to create a nice background associated with the falling words. Our gameplay goals ended up being originality, falling words that would build a background scene, simplicity of controls, a slight increase in difficulty as the game progresses, and a sense of happy calmness for the player. We tried to implement this last goal by using happy music and a calm, pretty, natural scene for the background. This ties in to our aesthetic goal which was serene beauty that promoted contentment. Originally, we had intended all of the art to be pixel art; I figured this would be easiest to make look clean and consistent. However, our attempts at consistent, pretty pixel art did not produce promising results, so we switched to just drawing simple images by hand.\n\nWe tried to keep all elements of the game simple from the player\u00e2\u0080\u0099s perspective. We used simple controls (just arrow keys), a simple camera system (fixed third-person), simple gameplay objectives (collect all of the falling words by colliding with them but avoid the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cEND\u00e2\u0080\u009d), simple art (2-D drawings with few colors and a flat texture), and simple sounds (just some light, happy music). This connects to the class concept of cohesion. We illustrated the class concept of progression by building the visual background as the player got closer to their goal of collecting all the words and used the class concept of variable difficulty level to a certain extent by using the progression mechanism to increase difficulty as the player progresses. Building the background visuals makes the player\u00e2\u0080\u0099s task harder because the new visuals are solid so the player must navigate their pencil icon around barriers to catch falling words. Though there is no obvious difficulty setting that the player can change, this solid visuals mechanism makes it so collecting words in one order may be more or less difficult than collecting them in a different order because it is harder to go around the mountain, for example, than a bird.\n\nAs mentioned above, we tried to make \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, Deer?\u00e2\u0080\u009d different from other games by making it neither a platformer nor a shooter. It is not really a maze, nor a puzzle, but somewhere in between with a bit of a time element as the player must catch words before they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve fallen off the screen. Thus the basic mechanism of the game is fairly innovative, if I do say so myself. Also, we tried to make the game happy, which, though not unique, is fairly unusual from what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen of other games. There is a theme of creation as the player builds a world and the use of a pencil as the player\u00e2\u0080\u0099s icon illustrates a somewhat subtle theme of drawing. The player is creating art, drawing their own world. This is in contrast to common themes of shooting or destroying objects or bad guys or evading enemies.\n\nPlaytesting alerted us to many possible improvements including having a restart mechanism, a separate start screen with instructions, a more obvious \u00e2\u0080\u009cend\u00e2\u0080\u009d word, and some sort of game-over mechanism. In one iteration, we had a game-over text sprite that appeared when the player collided with \u00e2\u0080\u009cend\u00e2\u0080\u009d, but we replaced this with an automatic reset of the layout. Though my dad didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t play the game, he gave me feedback on the art from looking at the game and this affected our decision to abandon the pixel art idea. After watching how people approached playing the game, how they moved around the screen and which words they went after, we realized we needed to adjust the speed of falling words and the player\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pencil icon. I increased the maximum speed of the pencil and increased the acceleration. After player/reader feedback, I changed the spawn points of all of the words so that the words fell from different places rather than each falling in the same place. I liked the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEND\u00e2\u0080\u009d spawn point mechanism I stumbled upon which used an orbiting behavior on the spawn sprite. This made some points more common for \u00e2\u0080\u009cEND\u00e2\u0080\u009d to spawn from and had an interesting side effect of producing \u00e2\u0080\u009cEND\u00e2\u0080\u009ds at weird orientations. I wanted to make smaller orbits for other words\u00e2\u0080\u0099 spawn points so they fell at different places but within a limited section of the screen, however, I could not figure out how to lock other words\u00e2\u0080\u0099 orientations, so I used wrap and bullet mechanisms for non-\u00e2\u0080\u009dEND\u00e2\u0080\u009d spawn points. This meant that the words could fall in any part of the screen, though I made some of the spawn points\u00e2\u0080\u0099 bullet speeds quite slow so the drop point location wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t change too drastically between drops. I let the bird word spawn points move faster because birds can fly all over the place.",

        "description": "For my gameplay goals of the game it was to create a game that I find challenging to make that I would gain a lot of experience from. After exploring what I was capable of doing with Construct 3 I decided I wanted to make a combat based game where you go through stages or rooms and fight of enemy AI that will lead you eventually to the boss where you fight it and rescue your wife. I had chosen to do this kind of game because I thought a platformer game was too simple, which was my original thought but after thinking for a bit the only base mechanics of that kind of genre (but not limited to) is jumping. With that in my mind I wanted a bigger area of player movement where they go around the map. For the aesthetics I explored some royalty free textures. I found a group royalty free from a website called kenny.nl and I was able to work with the textures and models that were provided. From the character models that were shown I knew I was going to go for a Dungeon styled RPG kind of feel because some of the monsters that I found were ghosts, spiders and skeletons. From there decisions I made for the game was based on the idea of what best suited the feeling of a creepy dungeon. The walls for example I thought were a good fit for the theme I was going for as a dungeon doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have detailed walls and are a simple brick patterns so I thought it worked out well. In addition dungeons are known for being dark and spooky. I got the spookiness from the monsters but for it being dark I got the background color to be a very dark purple which I thought suited the game rather than just a black background as that would do dull of a color. After that I felt there was a lot of empty space outside of the playing area, so to further incorporate the dungeon feeling I added some dead tees and filled up some extra space with some rivers due to the song I chose had some water dripping noise so I thought it would be a great fit. With the music I chose it enhanced the feeling of the game being a dungeon themed one as the music was very eerie.\n\nWith incorporating class concepts I learned, I made sure I had the 3 C\u00e2\u0080\u0099s done first. I had my character model picked out first which I though best suited the style of gameplay as it added to the spookiness as it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a faceless protagonist. For controls I used the arrow keys for the movement as that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a straight forward self explanation and for the camera I made sure the playing window followed the character as they navigate the map. In terms of mechanics I was able to incorporate a couple for my game. Firstly I used action and control as you have to avoid the monsters as they come up to you and shoot them before they touch you. Another mechanic I was able to incorporate was progression and feedback in the sense that you are going to room to room and go through multiple waves of different monsters and then finally the boss.\n\nThe final product of this game is the result of play testing to make sure systems are working correctly and efficiently. The first issue while play testing is that the hitboxes were to big. This resulted getting stuck on \u00e2\u0080\u009cinvisible walls\u00e2\u0080\u009d which is just the wall with a big hitbox. This issue happened with the character and monsters as the monsters would kill you by touching you but since the hitboxes were big they would technically kill you despite the pixels actually never touching each other. Another issue on play testing was the boss\u00e2\u0080\u0099 turret mechanic would shoot at me as soon as I spawned which resulted in spawn kills. So I had to make the bullet it shoots cancel on hitting the walls so I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get killed at spawn. Another issue that came up at playtesting was the respawn mechanics I was trying to employ. To do this I used set position so the player would get set back to an area. But once I would get set back to the position I set it would sling me across for a second. So I created a small barrier that would block you so that you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get slung.",

        "description": "The overall designed goal for this game is to make it a relaxing cute game. The design of the game lets players control the bunny to jump through different levels of conveyor belts in order to \u00e2\u0080\u009ceat\u00e2\u0080\u009d the desserts. There are five types of dessert, in total, coming out of machines. There are three specific types of desserts that the player needs to collect for a certain amount. The other two types, however, need to be avoided. The player wins the game when they reach the amount of all three kinds of desserts and still has life left. (Players have three lives at the beginning of the game, lives will be deducted each time the player eats a dessert that is supposed to be avoided) The aesthetic components that shape the player experience of this game are fantasy and challenge: By using pixel art elements and choosing the bunny as the character, I intended to make the game cute and relaxing. Moreover, in daily life, food makes people happy, especially desserts give people pleasure. The game intends to simulate eating dessert to create a satisfying feeling for the player. There are also challenges set in the game: the player needs to collect a certain amount of \u00e2\u0080\u009cright\u00e2\u0080\u009d dessert and manage to avoid the \u00e2\u0080\u009cwrong\u00e2\u0080\u009d ones to keep the game going and win. Players might accidentally misread the type of the dessert or collide with the wrong dessert accidentally when pressing the key. Overall, the player experience is supposed to be relaxing and nervous at the same time.\n\nThe mechanics of the game include the navigation of the character and character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s collision with the dessert object. Through the collision, the player either keep the game moving forward or associated with the game rules reducing the time the game left. In addition, the game uses progression mechanics, the progress bar, to give player feedback on their progress, telling them the progress of the game and what part they need to work on. I also applied one of the concepts introduced in the class, tuning the game. In order to tune the game to not too easy or not too difficult, I adjusted the numbers in the game, like frequency of the generation of dessert objects, numbers of types of dessert, numbers of dessert players need to collect to win the game, etc. The types of desserts coming out of the machines are set to be random. After all, the amount of the dessert controls the time of the game, and the three lives the character has are designed to control the difficulty of the game. \n\nThe design of the game was inspired by games like \u00e2\u0080\u009csky burger,\u00e2\u0080\u009d one of the matching games, in which player try to match specific types of slices of a hamburger falling from the sky. Besides, I also combined the game with platform games, which player control the character to run and jump through the platform. However, in this game, unlike platform games, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a loop background, which enables the player to run through the world. Instead, I used conveyor belts to let the bunny run and collect objects along the way. Also, compared to other games may use \u00e2\u0080\u009cbomb\u00e2\u0080\u009d to reduce character lives, we used a different method.\n\nWhen first setting the game, we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t set any \u00e2\u0080\u009cobstacle\u00e2\u0080\u009d for the game, the player could only collect the desserts without any behavior hurt her lives, so it became a game which players will never lose. Then we decided to set \u00e2\u0080\u009cbomb\u00e2\u0080\u009d to control the gameplay, so players will lose if they make some kinds of mistake and collide with a certain amount of bomb. In the end, I figured out another method to increase the difficulty of the game, why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we just turn two types of the dessert(five in total) to serve as \u00e2\u0080\u009cbombs\u00e2\u0080\u009d, which also let the player spend time to distinguish and make sure which dessert she needs to collect other than just distinguish dessert and bomb. During the design of the game, I originally intended to make the chance of the appearance of every type of dessert the same(random), but the random setting in the software Construct apparently is not random. Even though it was set to be random, one of the types of dessert players need to collect appears less than the others do. During the playtest, this bug making the game a bit harder turns out to be a good thing to tune the game. Players who played the game got a bit frustrated when they lose the game and they wanted to try another time, and by the end, they were able to win the game after about two or three times of play. The difficulty seems to be right for the game. Between playtest, I also adjust the number of dessert players needs to collect and the period of time new dessert object to be created on screen.",

        "title": "Commando Deer Saver",
        "description": "Imagine in the plain countryside, there is a surviving horde of deer. However, there is somebody behind this that has proven to be destructive to the environment and thus threatening the lives of all deer in this area. My game is about deer-saving. The game, Commando Deer Saver, scripted by me using Construct 3 software is about destroying enemies and saving deer.\n\nThe background story is about: in a not-so-distant future, the planet has fewer countries and more population growth rate than before. The most powerful energy tycoon controlled the economy of the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fossil fuel resources. As the demand for fuels become skyrocketed along with a failure of revolution in renewable energy, the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s energy would \u00e2\u0080\u009ccome to the end\u00e2\u0080\u009d. The enemy leader, also the big tycoon, is mysterious. Meanwhile, a formerly deer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s playground that is now captured by a power of the raised mysterious army and use it to protect shady businesses. They constructed a base and did not care about wildlife nearby. About a year later, the Environment Protection Agency soon constructed an investigation about deer. The agency surprisingly found the enemy they were looking for. So, (according to the twine game,) the agency raised a commander as a high official to teach the player to construct an army like the mystery army. Thus, the agency soon attacked the enemy with some losses and claimed a few victories. Now, (in the graphical game,) a commander acquired some deep intelligence about the enemy where there are more deer to be saved (according to the commander). So, the agency sent the commando Strong Deer to acquire some more information and construct an invisible psychic radar outside the base. Then the agency discovered the enemy is practicing shady businesses using pollutive materials to build nuclear reactors (prohibited in the world years ago) and some hazardous factories. After the strong deer is compromised his identity in his way, he was told that there is no way but fight. In the end, he destroyed the main power of the enemy, the base and saved all deer nearby. His mission was completed.\n\nThe plot twist is that after the mission, the player is told some dark truths about the saved deer from the commander (somebody sold those deer to another polluted area instead of really helping them, and the true goal is to build an empire funded by mystery instead of creating public goods and restart a revolution). So, the player would most likely choose to \u00e2\u0080\u009cassassinate the commander\u00e2\u0080\u009d but I did not tell the result. So, this part is what all the plot is about in the game. The last part can be fulfilled by imaginations. Players would experience different feelings about the topic of deer.\n\nThe art style, in my opinion, is in between realistic and cartoonish. All assets I used are not supposed to represent a certain organization or the country in this game. So, sometimes I used pixelization in some assets. Players might feel like the game is aesthetically a battlefield with sci-fi-like plots. Also, it is important for players to have fun since there is no wrong way to enjoy a game.\n\nIn the game \u00e2\u0080\u009ccommando deer saver\u00e2\u0080\u009d, there are concepts like \u00e2\u0080\u009cnouns\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cverbs\u00e2\u0080\u009d, which means items and moving, respectively. There are also mechanisms of 2-D walking. For example, precise walking could prevent the character from receiving damages. There is a \u00e2\u0080\u009cState space\u00e2\u0080\u009d which records all possible ways of playing a game. So, players can think about the best way of finishing this game (mostly by not dying). The character can be classified as \u00e2\u0080\u009cinteracting the world\u00e2\u0080\u009d so that players would combat like a \u00e2\u0080\u009ckiller\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\nThe game can let the character to destroy enemy units and save animals after that. This game could make players feel better when thinking about saving the world. It also includes a \u00e2\u0080\u009cnice\u00e2\u0080\u009d starting point which the shield can protect you from losing health. Lastly, the plot twist shows that the ending story is still unpredictable which is surprising. The last plot lets players think about what is right or wrong. So, this can be more innovative than some games I played before.\n\nIn two playtests, I gathered some suggestions from classmates. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say there are lots of improvement space in the older version of my game. The first suggestion is to make whether destroying the enemy base can be reflected in their behavior. In other words, the enemy can build units if the player did not destroy the buildings. So, I made the tank factory to build (spawn) a tank every ten seconds and directly point at the character. The second one is to make other moveable units move and attack the character. So, almost all tanks are moving and able to shoot toward the character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s direction every 2.5 seconds. The third one is to make a clear description of the controlling method. So, I describe how to play before players can start so that they would have a chance to be familiar with this game. The fourth one is to clarify the \u00e2\u0080\u009cnext step\u00e2\u0080\u009d because the game is easy to confuse players. So, all errors about coherent in the game are eliminated. The last one is to add a score that appears in the player\u00e2\u0080\u0099s display (HUD layer). This is simple; I also made a target score to tell players how many points to gather at the end of the game.\n\n After all, this is an amazing and inspiring experience. I learned how to make a minigame without programming skills. This is a good exercise in my career.",

Through this game, I want to tell the players a story about motherhood. This is the aesthetic goal of the game. The baby deer kills the enemies to save his mom. The baby deer needs to kill 30 tigers to save his mom. Because of the education goal, I try to make the story part equals to the gameplay part. In the class, we discussed about this concept. In my game, these two parts are equal.\u00c2\u00a0 At the beginning of the game, the baby deer needs to fight against eight initial tigers. I put two tigers in the display window, and six tigers out of the display window. Basically, the deer fights against eight tigers. Whenever one of the tigers died, another one will appear to replace the dead one. In order to win the game, players need to kill 30 tigers in total. The speed of the deer is faster than the speed of the tiger. The deer uses a gun to shoot the tigers. When the bullets hit the tigers, they explore and disappear. The tiger also disappears. When the deer hit one of the tigers, he is dead and disappears. I make this game has the simplest way to play. Players can only use the mouse to move, aim, and shoot. They can use arrow keys to move if they want. In this game, It seems easy to win, but It still has its difficulties. My classmates tested this game, when the loose, they restart the game immediately\u00c2\u00a0 to try to win the game. When I let my 8-year-old nephew played this game, he lost the game multiple times and he kept restarting the game multiple times until he won the game. That means my game still has the challenging.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\n\nThe nouns in my game are the deer and the tigers.\u00c2\u00a0 The verbs in my game are going left, going right, going up, and going down, shooting. I sign up on the website www.zapsplat.com to use their sound library. I chose the sound and music similar to the sound and music of the Nintendo console game. This was very interesting to me when I heard this sound.\u00c2\u00a0 On the image of the title page of the game, there are the deer, the tiger, and the deer's mom which is blurred. The deer and the tiger are very clearly because they are the main character. The deer's mom is blurred because she was trapped by the tiger. The mission of the deer is killing the tigers to release his mom. At the end of the game, when the players win the game, the baby deer meets his mom. Beneath them is the failure tiger. The deer and his mom are standing on the tiger. This image tells the players that \"you are the winners\".\u00c2\u00a0\n\nIn this game, I try to decrease the violence factor by using the animation \"boom\" when the bullets hit the tigers. Because my players are children, I do not want them to see too much violence in this game. I want the players to think of this game as a cartoon. This is another aesthetic of the game.\u00c2\u00a0 My game was better because I changed some features from the feedback of the testers. In the beginning, I make the speed of the tigers were very fast. This made the tigers can kill the deer easy. My classmate test my game and said that I need to make the tigers slower and the bullets need to go faster. These changes make the game easier to play and win. Jordan recommended using the mouse to move the player. I thought that was a good idea and I used it. This recommendation makes my game very easy to play. My game seems simple when I compared it to the other games. It is simple, but it still meets its goals. At some points, my game has a innovative idea. The animation of the explosion when the bullets hit the tigers is one. The story of the game is a good concept to educate the children about the motherhood of the baby deer. It also helps the children in loving the animal, treat them as people.",

        "title": "Soulmate",
        "description": "There is a various way to make a game engages class concepts. For example, we can just substitute characters on an already existing game to a dear. However, I and Donghyun (project mate) thought that it is too boring, and we wanted to create a novel and original game. To find inspiration for the game, we watched Ludum Dare, which is an indie game development competition that participants make their own game from scratch within 72 hours. We could find various indie games with brilliant ideas. When we find a game that is adding poker with Pac man (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMmS8l3pGes#t=3s), we realized that adding a small feature on already existing games makes it much more brilliant and enjoyable. Therefore, we came up with an idea that \u00e2\u0080\u0098What about playing two platform game simultaneously?\u00e2\u0080\u0099, and make our game. The name of our game is \u00e2\u0080\u0098You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a friend in me\u00e2\u0080\u0099. The reason why we chose this name is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about soul mate kiwi birds. To implement the concept of \u00e2\u0080\u0098playing two platform games simultaneously\u00e2\u0080\u0099, we came up with a couple of kiwi birds who behave the same way. Because they are soul mate, they always act the same. If the player presses the right arrow key, both of them will move to the right. If the player presses up arrow key, both of them will jump. However, the map that each kiwi bird needs to get through is different, the player needs to think about both Kiwi birds at the same time. Therefore, we succeed in making a game that the user plays two normal platform games simultaneously while engaging one of the class concepts(soul mate).However, we wanted more functionality that shows two kiwi birds are a soul mate. Therefore, we came up with another apparatus, which is a string between them.Initially, the string between them is green. It means they are in a stable situation. However, the color changes to red as their distance gets further. And finally, the string is snapped, game overs. By adding this string apparatus, the player needs to keep them close. This function not only gives another enjoyable rule but also emphasizes that they are a soul mate. The two apparatus, which are \u00e2\u0080\u0098two kiwi birds act same\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and \u00e2\u0080\u0098they need to get close to each other \u00e2\u0080\u0098 is the most innovative part of our game. By controlling two characters that moving simultaneously, it already has its uniqueness from the existing game. In the normal platform game, what users do is just controlling one character, dodge obstacles, and collect coins. However, by adding just one more character gives fresh player experience compare to the normal game. \n\nAfter we implemented all the basic functions, we wanted to add a variation to the game. We wanted to add different types of obstacles, and a different atmosphere. Therefore, we made a total of three stages. Whenever users enter the next stage, new kind of obstacles is added. For example, in stage 2, users need to dodge flying shuriken which does not exist in stage 1 and needs to be careful when walking on a fragile block on stage 3, which does not exist in stage 2.Also, we wanted to make our game more aesthetic. Therefore, we changed the background image and block color so that users do not get bored with the same atmosphere of the game. And we discussed how to end the game. We decided to end the game if the two soul mate finally meets with each other. Therefore, we make the last part of the platform opened so that two characters can meet. If they meet each other, the player can see the ending scene.\n\nThis is the ending part of our game. We wanted to draw two soul mates who were happy to meet.Therefore, we depicted two soul mate playing, walking, and seeing together. When we conducted playtesting, we got several feedbacks, which are (1) The difficulty of each stage was too high(2) There is no music, so the game is bland.(3) It will be better if you add checkpoints. We strongly agreed with the first feedback. Because even Donghyun was not able to clear the first stage. When we make a map for each stage, we did not care about the difficulty. We just added obstacles as many as we wanted. Therefore, lots of users complained about they even cannot complete the first stage. After we got this feedback, we reduced the number of obstacles on every stage.We also added different background music for each stage. We also noticed that the game needs appropriate background music for each stage. Therefore, we chose some background music that goes with each stage and added it.And in the case of the last feedback, we thought that adding a checkpoint does not match with our game concept. The concept of the game is \u00e2\u0080\u0098Getting through lots of obstacles with the soul mate, and finally, meet each other again.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Therefore, we wanted the player to overcome every obstacle at one go. Therefore, we did not add a checkpoint on this game. Rather than adding checkpoints, we decreased the difficulty of the game so that the player does not feel annoyed by hundred times of retry.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0",

        "description": "Within my game, SpaceTime, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a singular purple cuboid in outer-space. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not entirely clear why you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a purple cuboid, or in outer-space. The objective of the game is to traverse your way through an isometric layout of platforms until you reach the \u00e2\u0080\u009cWinBlock\u00e2\u0080\u009d sprite, at which it will either advance you to the next level after three seconds, or state \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou Win.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The catch? There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a randomly generated asteroid field as well as space junk that floats across your path. Colliding with either results in restarting. The other catch? Time is frozen when you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t move, and resumes when you do move. Being a purple cuboid floating in space, I wanted to aesthetically convey a feeling of certainty to the player. Everything (besides controls and the time mechanic) is immediately clear--\u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m in space. I must be the purple cuboid, and I suppose I have to travel across the platforms.\u00e2\u0080\u009d While being aesthetically pleasing (and somewhat ominous), I figured space would guide the player without much needed explanation.\n\nSpaceTime engages with multiple class concepts. We discussed uncertainty and randomness, which comes into play with the spawning of the asteroids and space junk. The difference between suspense and surprise is evident in SpaceTime, too. The game is heavily suspenseful--the player sees where they must go and what they must avoid, but they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get there yet. We also covered gender in games, which SpaceTime engages with by being entirely neutral. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe there is a single aspect of the game which suggests any one particular gender created it, or that there is a target audience. We also discussed game genres, and our personal experience with games. This is a challenging, platformer bullet-hell, which is much of what I have played in the past. Also, to tease out underlying symbolism in the game (which we did a lot throughout the course, i.e. Passage), SpaceTime can represent any person living their own life with constant obstacles being thrown in their path. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a reminder that taking the time to stop and think about your decisions can benefit your future greatly, and rushing things often results in setbacks, or even restarting completely. It demonstrates that taking a step backwards can be necessary for achieving your goal.\n\nThe major time-related mechanic in SpaceTime takes inspiration from SUPERHOT, a first-person-shooter action mystery game where time moves extraordinarily slowly when the player doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t move. In terms of innovation, SpaceTime is an isometric platformer that engages SUPERHOT\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time mechanic (although time stops completely when the player doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t move in SpaceTime), which I have yet to encounter elsewhere. Also, one could argue that the decision to make an isometric view-point game is innovative, since the industry very rarely produces any games of the type (Tyranny is one I can name). The setting, abstraction, and aesthetic of the game combine to also be innovative, avoiding any type of character representation and lean towards gendered themes or political viewpoints.\n\nSpaceTime has undergone several changes from play-testing feedback. In the original alpha, it was difficult to see where/when an asteroid would collide with the players hitbox. This has been improved by implementing drop shadows to the asteroids. If the base of the player touches the drop shadow, the player will restart the level. On top of this, I added a couple new sprites. The original grey isometric cubes have now been replaced by a more stylized, dark cyan platform. Now, alongside the asteroids, space junk (in the form of a metal bar) will float as an additional object to be avoided. I also implemented drop shadows on the space junk, and a slight shadow on the base of the purple cuboid character, making it look less like they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re moving through the platform and rather above it. SpaceTime also only had a single level, so I created a second one that is larger, with varying sizes of tiles, as suggested. With this, I had to implement a level switch, teleporting the player to the new level two upon completion of level one. One major challenge (as well as conflicting point of feedback) was the movement style of the character. I received six different comments on the movement, two of which wished for it to be changed to better fit the angle/style of the isometric cubes. Four suggested I keep the same 8-directional movement, as it added the ability to fully navigate each individual tile. I myself would\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve liked to change it, but I found it difficult to implement without uprooting most of the logic I already had in place. Ultimately, the movement is 8-directional, as the majority of play testers suggested.\u00c2\u00a0",

        "description": "The aesthetic inspiration that I took to create my platformer game, were from old arcade game and Minecraft. My game is inspired by these games because I made the design for the object and the character of my platformer to be created looking pixelated. It might not seem that Minecraft was part of the inspiration beside of the pixelated and block design. However, I have recently gone back to Minecraft and has been the only videogame that has been playing this entire summer session. Some of the Aesthetic I took from Minecraft that looking back at my game I came to realize was the cave adventure aspect in whole. In Minecraft, the way to level up and advance in the game is to take an adventure in the cave to discover rare treasure. Were in Minecraft are diamond and iron, however, the treasure is an actual treasure chest. Another game mechanic that I have taken from Minecraft is the digging/block destruction of blocks. However, I game my game a restriction and the only block you are able to destroy the dirt block and is only able to be accessible when the player explorers a stage and discover the shovel and unlocks the ability to dig/destroy dirt block.\n\nA concept that I took and applied to my game is creating a game that keeps the player a sense of progressively advancing difficulty. In the first few stages, I made the layout of the game restricted to only the visible screen of the game. And in the layout, I tried to keep the level of advancing the game to a straight forward idea that there is a door and the key, therefore, the player needs to make the connection in order to advance I must grab the key to unlock the door to the next stage. As the level progress, I introduced a new element to the game as the different orientation of the moving enemy and moving platform. Even at one point, I introduced a new mechanic digging to the game as the only way to advance to the next stage of the level. However, how I mainly make the level incrementally more difficult is the appearance of the enemy and the speed at how the enemy and deadly object come towards the enemy and enable his easy walkthrough of the game.\n\nAs I was creating the game, I first started making the game I did not think of a return route for the game, however, as I further created the game, I taught it would be a little twist for the adventure to try to escape with the treasure. As I asked people to playtest my game, they pointed out that I took some Indiana Jones Adventure factor to my game. I asked them \u00e2\u0080\u009cOn how they came to that conclusion?\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and they responded, \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe find the treasure and escape was a classic trope found in the movies. However, something unique or twist that I believed that my platformer game is that it has a Mario control vibe, however, it is set up like an Indiana Jones Adventure. I do not believe that I have developed any new aspects in-game, however, I have incorporated existing mechanics in games into a different platformer game. The incorporation I had in my games where Mario Platformer, Minecraft theme that leads to creating an Indiana Jones Adventure Game.\n\nOn playtesting on the alpha game, feedback that greatly helps in fixing a major flaw in the game was to emphasize the importance of collecting the key for the game. In the Alpha, I just had the key with no information or hint that states to collect them. Therefore, I added a door to each level of the game, in which the player can infer that there is both a key and door, hence, they will need to collect them to advance to the next stage. \u00c2\u00a0Some other feedback that I have received from playtesting is that the game was impossible to land on some of the moving platformers. To Fix this issue of the landing of the platform I either made the platform either increase the period time of interval, make the platform larger for higher chances of landing or both. Something that came up while playtesting that was embarrassing was that at some point, I have made the game impossible to pass if the player has not collected enough lives\u00e2\u0080\u0099 that he was able to lose to further advance with the game. After, that playtest I moved many obstacles to an appropriate distance from one another to allow the player to advance through this stage without any life if he was careful, however, will require a life or two if the player decided just to rush through the stage. After, incorporating all their feedback in the game I made a game that looks like Indiana Jones, plays like Mario and is not Impossible to pass. .\n\nHomepage Screen-  Vecteezy name \"Forest Scene with Cave\"Level 1,2 -  iStock Getty Image By VectorUp, Level 3,4,5,6 - Pinterest by Dylan Faust, Fountreaser Screen- Pinterest Ultionus Background 02 By Rosemary Reynolds",

        "description": "The word I choose to base my game off of was deer. In the story, a magical deer leads you to fantasy area where you have to navigate and hopefully escape back to the real world.  When I was revising my game some of the suggestions I kept in mind were  about the linearity of the game (lack of diverse endings/paths), uninteresting dead ends and some unclear links.  By dropping most of the action links to the bottom of the page  I was able to make options a bit more clear to the players.  In order to address the linearity and dead end problems, I added a lot more content  while trying to cut unnecessary  paths in my game.  The feeling I was trying to achieve with this game was a feeling of fantastical exploration.  By making a somewhat \"open world\" that you could explore, players could try and complete the game as fast as they can or they could take your time and  find some more rewarding and interesting endings (such as exploring the stream, finding a key, and using the key for an ending). Although making a \"open world\" in a text based format  is difficult I added a lot of description to the text to help the immersion.",

        "description": "The theme which I incorporated into my branching narrative was \"falling\" and is interpreted as a slippery slope. My story is a somewhat dark and occasionally comedic experience where you are a knight on a quest accompanied by your page. You happen across a sorcerer's cave filled with enticing things to find and play with, but you have to be careful or you may find that you have bitten off more than you can chew....\nThere are many paths of the branched narrative which allow the player to get engrossed in some magical item and start playing with it until they can no longer choose not to; thus, falling in this game is being so enticed by benign-seeming objects or magical things. However, this branched narrative truly  is most fun when the player simply embraces whatever they finds most enticing and allows themself to fall into the dream, irrelevant what consequences might result.\nIn my revision of this game for the Twine Beta assignment, I tried to make it look visually darker and more menacing--which may reduce the comedic effect observed in playtesting, but I did think that it would match the theme well.  Additionally, I went through and edited almost all of the passages so that the writing was more thematically cohesive and I tried to increase the character interaction throughout the game without doing serious structural reform. At it's essence, the game is not as much about interacting with the sorcerer or even with your page as it is about seeing what happens when you interact with the environment.",

When we are in fight or flight mode, we see tons of potential pathways to a solution and it can be overwhelming because we can only focus on one option at a time and we can't predict the future. Therefore the first passage has a lot of links that feel like they can take you down different paths. I wanted the user to feel like every decision mattered, and that at first there were lots of options, but options become more narrow as you go down a certain path.\n\nI added CSS styling to give it clean look and palatable feel, yet only be in shades of black and white -- it may be hard to find the links until your mouse hovers over them and they change colors. When I am stressed and hurried, I always look for the quick and easy option. Therefore, I tried to make the user read the passage instead of just clicking on the first hyperlink. Also, some links take you to the same passage as other links, giving the illusion that there is more options to choose from. I added a tangential \"phone call\" with an automated system which again has too many options and would be frustrating if you were in a hurry.  \n\nI made the writing style lighthearted and humorous because the story revolves around anxiety and being stressed in traffic. Hopefully it is fun to read and stressful (but not too stressful) to play.",

You will be given the chance to use your expertise to help a lead team of engineers and save the world.\n\nThe Call is a science fiction, Choose Your Own Adventure type game that allows the player to make risk-based choices.

        "description": "Our original intention for Fallen Down, was a cherub statues looking for pieces of his friend throughout an art museum, although the limitations of the project prevented us from expanding too much on that Idea, so we settled for a little cherub trying to make his way through literal hell to get back home. The art style was originally going to be more renaissance to make the ideas of heaven and hell fit in more, but we eventually adapted a pixel art style after a lapse in communication. There were a few unused enemy sprites and modifications we had to do, but in the end, the art style seemed to fit well with the theme of biblical stuff. The gameplay turned out a lot better for my first 2D platformer, and I was satisfied with the amount of work I got to do on the actual commands for the enemies, player movements and stage hazards. I found work arounds to seemingly complex problems, which I feel bodes well for my future in programming, like the restart issue i was spending near hours on. The core mechanics I found to be a bit floaty, but still controllable, helping to add the player immersion to the cherub's flying abilities. We made sure this time to properly include the theme for our project this time, as our little cherub buddy has fallen down to hell and is trying to make his way through progressively less demonic areas to reach his home and friends in heaven. The theme incorporated would be falling, and on a less literal note, the cherub seems to be \"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" falling\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\" into tougher and tougher situations as he climbs to the top, almost as if the difficulty of his mission is trying to keep him down. The Cherub, whenever he dies, also falls back to the bottom of his journey, having to start all over again, no matter how close he may be to freedom. A lot of what this game originally struggled with was the jumping and movement mechanics, and after a while, I found different commands to be viable and more effecient then the previous ones. That in itself being at the basis of all programming, I felt more confident dealing with the other technical issues presented to me. One of the technical issues was the ability to glide and shoot, which before, was originally impossible,but after a quick shift of conditions and events, I had to while gliding or not, the cherub would fire at the same rate. There was a point in between all of that where you could just glide and spam arrows, which obviously wouldn't fly on my watch. A lot of the other issues came with the level layouts, which I think we addressed well enough. The first issue surrounded the turrets, and how players may find it less challenging to have them constantly firing at you, so I added vulnerability to ground and arrows for bullets and turrets respectively. Another issue was the build up of difficulty throughout the levels and how we'd introduce new mechanics and/or enemies. I tried making it so everything the cherub would encounter in the game, the player would encounter within the first few seconds of gameplay (aside from the upgraded enemies of course). From there, it was up to us to properly pace the other areas to utilize these mechanics in new ways that challenged the player to think on their toes a bit more. Naturally, with all progression, the final area is the toughest, using these familiar concepts and launching you into the proverbial laundry machine. There is fire everywhere, making the need for precise platforming vital,\u00c2\u00a0 as well as having quicker turrets fire at you relentlessly.\u00c2\u00a0 I did feel however that the ending was a little anti-climactic, but I think the end card makes do for this project. We also would have liked to include music and sounds effects, but it appears they just didn't make it in in time for the due date,(or the sound effects are there and I didn't know, I couldn't play the game with the sound on). However I do know the fundamental flaw in this game; it doesn't really try anything new, even with the story. \"Little angel falls from heaven and climbs back up, he can glide and shoot arrows\" feels sadly cliche to me. That doesn't mean I like my game any less, it just means that it can't really stand out amongst the crowd .\u00c2\u00a0 I had an Idea to make the arrows have a bit of delay before firing, (like Simon Belmont and his whip attacks in the original Castlevanias), but it never came through. The artwork I was proud of, and I had a lot of fun bouncing ideas back and forth with Sam. I'd much like to use this project and expand it more in the future in my own time, just to see what I can accomplish on my own.\n\n-- Sophia Muren, Lead Programmer of Fallen Down\n\nFallen Down is an action platformer in which the player, a cherub, must escape Hell to return home to Heaven. We drew inspiration from traditional platformers such as Kirby, Mario, and Megaman, but wanted to put our own spin on the genre. We wanted to make a game that was cute and fun, but challenging as well. The design of the player character and demons are cartoonish and lighthearted, and rendered in an 8-bit style that harkens back to older games. Fallen Down is innovative compared to other games because it features gliding and shooting as core mechanics. Many games, like Mario or Kirby have these features as power-ups, but we decided that including them would fit the theme of the game (the player being a cherub) and allow for more challenging levels, given that the player has these tools from the beginning. Challenges include fast-firing turrets, wide jumps the player must cross by gliding, and large enemies with high health. Player feedback helped us tweak our game and make it as good as it could be. During the first round of playtesting, players found bugs and hidden shortcuts we hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t intended. This helped us fortify our levels to keep them interesting and challenging. They also helped us figure out spacing and difficulty --\u00c2\u00a0 initially, the blank background and empty space made it hard for some players to navigate the levels. We added more features, enemies, and walls to make use of this space instead of letting it go to waste, making for a more interesting game that has a natural flow of progression. Initially, we weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t using the glide feature to its full potential. Our playtesters helped us see that adding obstacles such as fire and ground enemies could get players to use gliding and have fun with it. Philip, our student TA, also helped us think about how to use enemies to their fullest potential instead of letting them be fodder for the player\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arrows. His feedback helped us place our enemies more strategically. Philip and another student also made good suggestions about spawn points. We decided to only let players respawn at the start of the game instead of having checkpoints; it fits better with the size of the game and encourages players to learn carefully from their actions.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0My teammate, Sophia, also had the idea to create title and end cards as an introduction and reward for the player. The end card is an image of the cherub flying to meet one of his friends. In our alpha, we did not have any reward for the player when they reached the end of the stage, which made it disappointing for our playtesters. But we got some nice reactions to Sophia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heartwarming art when we playtested our beta in section. This satisfying end not only helps the game feel complete, but gives the player\u00e2\u0080\u0099s journey meaning. We also learned important lessons about design from class. We made it a point to link our fantasy to our gameplay. As mentioned beforehand, gliding and shooting arrows are things that cherubs typically do. As the player moves through the levels of hell, they also progress upwards through the stage toward the surface. Demons, mortal enemies of angels, seek to attack the player and slow them down. When the player reaches the outside, the platforms become clouds instead of jagged rocks. Aside from these design choices, we also chose not to have a point system, so as not to incentivize killing. In this game, sneaking past enemies to get home is just as viable as shooting them. For the cherub, the goal isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t to hack and slash -- the goal is to return home, and the player can decide how they want to go about it. The gameplay is focused more on action than story, but the game itself is the story of how the cherub gets home to his friends. The player has a choice whether to be violent or not (although it does not have a bearing on the outcome of the game). Also learning from the pitfalls of crunch at major game studios, we tried to balance work between ourselves as well as balance work over the duration of our project so that it did not pile up. We made executive decisions on what to keep and what to cut, as well. Initially the game was going to have five levels and a completely different theme, but we scaled it down to be more manageable for the both of us. Although we grew attached to many of our early ideas, we learned to be aware of how they would affect the gameplay and let go of concepts that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fit our vision. Most importantly, we made a game that we would want to play ourselves. We both wanted a challenging game with cute art, a unique protagonist, and a sweet story. We learned a lot about working as a team to build this game, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re happy with the result.\n\n--Samantha Prado, Lead Art Director of Fallen Down ",

I wanted to make players to encourage themselves to restart the game by themselves and experience every paths of the game. \nI added images and some passages based on the feedback.\n- Added passage before the rescue team arrived\n- Add multiple options for how to catch a rabbit(using oranges as a bait or use axe/knives to catch rabbit)\n- You can kill a bear when you have an axe.\nI have playtested several times and debugged my game.",

        "description": "For our game, my partner and I chose the word \u00e2\u0080\u009cSoulmate\u00e2\u0080\u009d as our theme. In order to encapsulate this word, we decided to make a platformer with a bit of a twist. In our game the player is put into a calming world with platforming challenges that get progressively more difficult. In the game, the player controls 2 characters on separate \u00e2\u0080\u009cscreens\u00e2\u0080\u009d and does their best to navigate and beat each level. To complete levels, a player must have patience, awareness, and skill in order to move on. Some obstacles players must face include, bugs that move back and forth, deadly pitfalls, spikes, and moving spike bars. Many of the tricky jumps in the game take patience to make rather than speed running it through. This allows the player to absorb more of their surrounding and hopefully feel more immersed. For our, aesthetic we went for a common looking platformer. Rather than have something sci-fi or fantastical, we wanted to use a happy and innocent look in order to capture our theme of soulmate. Because we were also limited on animation possibilities and didn't use too much text, our game is more gameplay oriented rather than story oriented.\u00c2\u00a0 Together, these elements create a serene game with mainly challenging gameplay based elements.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\n\nAs previously mentioned the goal of this game was to make a platformer that had mechanics reflecting the theme word of \u00e2\u0080\u009csoulmate\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Doing this reflects the reading on Metaphor vs. Mechanics and how games such as Risk, Monopoly, and Magic the Gathering all integrate their key themes into their gameplay. Personally I believe that our metaphorical mechanics is very strong. In this game we also tried to make characters that the player could also relate themselves with. Typically, when thinking of a soulmate, one tends to think about a male and female couple but to help more people relate to the game, we chose to use basic, cute stick figure looking sprites that are human. In the game there is also very basic mechanics that we went over in class.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nOur game is a very simple platformer at the surface but with a twist that leads to many new possibilities. Since we chose the word soulmate, we decided to use that metaphor and turn it into a new \u00e2\u0080\u009cmechanic\u00e2\u0080\u009d by adding a second player that is bound to the first. In addition to controlling the second character, the player must watch out for the second character as the two characters move and die together. Not only does this help extend the soulmate metaphor, but it also creates new mechanics and adds depth to gameplay. In many ways the game is still similar to classic platformers such as Super Mario, in that they share common enemies and ways to die. However, since there is a second player added in our game more depth is added to this classic genre. Since both character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deaths are linked, this create a puzzle for the player to navigate. They must be cognizant at all times, watching and thinking about where each character will land. Although not added, more mechanics and interactions between both \u00e2\u0080\u009cscreens\u00e2\u0080\u009d could be implemented. An idea for this could be something like a player on the top screen being able to push a box onto a button allowing the second player to have access to something. This would add a more puzzly element to the game, in turn adding even more depth overall.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nInitially our game was too difficult as we had gotten used to the mechanics in the game so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we mainly focused on redesigning. In our final game people said that it was just the right amount of challenging to keep them going. Some people made remarks on the only decent art on which I would have to agree. However for the most part the gameplay seemed to be the highlight as we hoped it would be. Others also liked how the mechanic of 2 people moving together was implemented but it may be interesting to see what it would be like if the game was multiplayer and if it had more interactions between the two screens. Overall I think the feedback was generally good because of the people we asked. I believe that there is still a lot of room for improvement in areas, particularly in art. Other things that could be added are more mechanics and maybe more levels for those mechanics to be placed in. Some also remarked that the end screen should be something a little more impactful that just a white screen and I agree with that.",

        "title": "Panda Jump",
        "description": "Our game is called Panda Jump, as what the name is, the main character is a Panda, which is controlled by players to move on the platform or jump onto the clouds. The theme of our game is Falling. After players win the game, the Panda will fall through all the clouds until it arrives at the floor. Players can play the game in no time limitation by clicking the buttons to play again. In total it has two levels. For each level, players need to control the Panda to jump onto the clouds to get 4 bamboos by touching them to win. After passing the first level, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cnext level\u00e2\u0080\u009d button to get to the second level Panda Jump 2 which is an upgrade version of Panda Jump. Players need to jump onto One-piece clouds without touching them in this level. The instruction of the game will show on the screen after players start each level. The red arrows are the hint of directions that the Panda could move to. Double jump in the game is enabled, so players can enjoy using the keyboard to jump.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nPanda Jump is a game full of Chinese elements. Firstly, the giant panda is considered as the national treasure in China. The main character Panda is an animation of the real giant panda, it has the such as the black eyes, the black ears, the small black tail, and the white belly. Secondly, the color of our game is mainly black and white, which not only match the color of the Panda but also match our goal to make this game simple and enjoyable. Comparing to the black and white background, the green \u00e2\u0080\u009cbamboos\u00e2\u0080\u009d, red arrows and colorful texts are more obvious to players. In such a way, the instruction of the game is very clear to our audiences and it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t destroy the simple style we want to build up. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more, the background music of Panda Jump is an adapted version of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cSuper Mario\u00e2\u0080\u009d. This music mixed a lot of Chinese instrument like the ancient zheng, which is slower and beautiful. Also, we add sounds which will play when the Panda gets bamboo to attract players to get more bamboos until they win.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\nThe Core Mechanics of Panda Jump is clear. The Panda and its bamboos are nouns. Moving the Panda to the left or right and jumping or double-jumping onto the clouds to touch the bamboos are verbs. And the grammar is shown above which is the instructions. A complete game needs to be not that easy to win or lose, so we add some difficulties in the process of playing the game. For example, in each level of our game, when the Panda jump higher, the number of clouds is decreasing which means the top is the hardest to jump. Besides, according to the Blizzard Game Pillar, we design this game based on the fun of the game. We add small but clear texts to engage our audiences to have fun on it and understand the rules as fast as they see the text consisting of one or two sentences. We aim to let the players spend the shortest time to understand how to play this game, and have more time to enjoy playing the game and get the victory message. For example, when players control the Panda to touch the first bamboo in the first level and the \u00e2\u0080\u009cboom\u00e2\u0080\u009d animation begins to play, the \u00e2\u0080\u009cscore\u00e2\u0080\u009d made of four empty bamboos under the cloud will be filled one showing with the rule message saying that \u00e2\u0080\u009cyou need to get all four bamboos to win this game...\u00e2\u0080\u009d. We think it is better than just showing a text before starting the game since It helps the players to understand the \u00e2\u0080\u009cgrammar\u00e2\u0080\u009d quickly when playing the game. Playing is the best way of learning.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\nWe were supposed to do a game about water, and our graphical game alpha is a outline that using a physical effect to make water dropping from the top. However, we change our topic and content in the process since we want to make a game that is innovative both in its style and on its goal. Since both of us are born in China and we are all familiar with Chinese culture, instead of making a game that is difficult and skillful, we are more willing to design a simple game full of details using things we are good at. As a result, we choose the Chinese style using many Chinese elements and make a game which is simple and clear. The action of our game is similar to Doodle Jump, a game controlling the character\u00e2\u0080\u0099s direction of jumping. Comparing to Doodle Jump, our game is using the four-way buttons on the keyboard to control the character, we can control it to jump or stay, also, double-jump is enabled in our game, so the character can move farther to get where they want. The most important thing is that not like Doodle Jump that only has sounds, our game has both sounds and background music. It is important since music is a great way to attract audiences.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\nIn the lab sections, we and other teams playtested each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s games and we got a lot of feedback and ideas from them. We repaired a lot of bugs appearing in the process of playtesting, also, we add some instruction texts at the beginning and some arrows to guide the players. One of the teams gave the advice that we need to emphasize the theme word,\u00c2\u00a0 so when passing each level, we set the Panda to fall through the clouds and get to the floor to call back our theme word \u00e2\u0080\u009cFalling\u00e2\u0080\u009d. At the end of our game, after victory message shows up, we add a button \u00e2\u0080\u009cplay again\u00e2\u0080\u009d for players to play as much as they want. All the feedback are important to us and give us a lot of ideas to improve our game. I am so willing to accept other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advice on our game since it is so helpful. And I have a lot of fun doing this project!",

As time goes on this forms a misunderstanding from Rin towards Sakura, as Rin believes Sakura's teacher has been purposefully hurting her. As Sakura suicides herself, Rin's belief comes to a determination for revenge. She believes that she knows everything about Sakura since they are soulmates, and this belief finally let her to make fake evidence in accusing their teacher.\nI want to let my players know the kind of misunderstanding at the end.

You found what you were looking for: a ridiculously heavy slab of rock called the Statue of Akamentu, said to contain a precious metal that can be found nowhere else on Earth. The statue is much too heavy for you to lift, so you slide it across the floor towards the exit. As you do, the ground shakes and the exit collapses, trapping you inside. Now you must push the statue through the treacherous and icy corridors in an attempt to escape.",

        "description": "Our team designed this game based on the theme word Traffic. The main reason about this is that Traffic could be an easy theme to create game. It is a simple game, but we actually met lots of difficulties during the process. The final project actually has huge differences with what I thought.\n\nFor example, at the beginning, to best express the theme word we chose, we decided to use elements like little cars and a highway to construct it. In our game, players just need to use arrow keys to control. In my mind, the motion of our little red car should be regular. There are 4 lanes in the highway. When player press left or right bottom, the red car should only move one lane and also the same distance. We tried to let it move like 50 on the X coordination, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seems stupid when the car moves and has some conflict with other settings. Therefore, we finally changed to the way that move as much as players want.\n\nThere are some other kind of vehicles like police cars and some other color ones as well, these are what players need to avoid in our game. We used to put them on arranged places on a long highway which used to provide extent playable time. The difficulty change will increase or decrease those arranged cars. However, I thought that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boring if someone want to play it again, so we changed the background to a loop and randomly create vehicles on highway. Difficulties will increase with time goes on and reach a maximum. Also, we used to have an end point on the highway, we removed it when we decided to loop the background. Under this circumstance, there is no winning condition and no way to win this game. We just set a limit life and a score based on time. In other words, players need to do their best to survive on this highway.\n\nWhen we tested the game, I found our game is more playable then the initial goal. The red car used to be only allowed to drive on 4 lanes, but now I can control it avoid other vehicles with a very close distance. Also, sometimes it seems surrounded by other vehicles, but they will destroy themselves by collisions. These elements make our game more playable.\n\nXuqi and Kaisen usually say our game looks like drive on highway 17, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t agree with them. Highway 17 is dangerous because of its winding topography, but in our game is dangerous because of those rude vehicles. We set those 3 different vehicles with three different speed. When two of them collide with each other, both will be destroyed and explosive. We hope people will know how dangerous it is when driving rude.\n\nWe played lots of examples in construct 3 and see how it works to make our game better and innovative. The initial long highway is a typical example. We didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how to make a highway at the beginning until we played the game Glokar. It uses several repeated backgrounds to make the playable time long enough. So we make our game just like it, but unfortunately we found this method is not suitable for our game. All of those games are awesome whatever on graph or entertainment. We try to learn how to make a game through their eventsheets, but some of them are too difficult to understand and some function are not free. In this case, we asked Tas and try to make our idea possible in our own way. For example, we want to make our car be unbeatable after one collision and flash. We made our car unable to touch and disappear a while and appear a while to create a flash scene. However, suddenly we found that there is a flash function, then we had to modify it. Finally, we successfully make a playable endless which brings more possibility to players. We overcome some difficulties and avoid some difficulties. We set random vehicles, which could give the game more possibilities like survive from besiege after enemies collide with others. We create a loop background to make the game have long enough play time. We give the red car a smooth control to give player chance to find gap to avoid their surround. I believe all of these elements could make our game innovative.\n\nAlthough there were so many problem and difficulties, we believe we did our best to create a good playable game.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\nXuqi and I made lots of changes in our game on July 26, when Kaisen is on flight back to China, so there maybe some differences between his statement and our game.",

        "description": "Theme words used Soulmate, Deer\nReason for Designing this Game\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a summer session student, and I stayed in UCSC for approx.10 days. The first thing that impressed me in here is that you can see deers everywhere on campus, even in front of your dormitories. I liked them and tried to be friend with them, but I failed to get closer to them every time. Therefore, after I heard the keyword about deer, I decided to make a game with deer.\nThe second reason for designing this game is due to the fact that my English skills are not that good. I thought I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sufficient to make a complicated and mysterious game. Also, most of my friends are already combining their games with survival moods, mathematical questions, and lots of heavy topics. So I decided to make a light-weighted sweet game for kids.\nLinks\nLinks are used for basically two purposes in this game. First, some links are just button to move to the next passages, next stories. They just move players to another situation or themes. Second, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099re some links for players to make choices. Depending on their choices, the affinity between them and deer can increase, or they might fail.\nEndings&Design Goal\nThis game has one hidden ending for fun, but it basically has only one end. It might not be desirable because regardless of the decisions they make, every player will eventually end up in the same ending. But I have to purpose to design my game in this way.\nFirst, basically I designed this game for kids, and I thought players have to feel success eventually.\nThey might have various player experiences depending on what choices player made in the middle. Even though two main failure messages are not an ending itself, they might be treated as a sub-ending where players have to start from the beginning. Even though the end is fixed to success, there might be some difficulties and differences to reach there.\nPlayer Experiences.\nI want players to feel both difficulties of making a friend(or becoming a friend with deer, specifically) and kind of happiness when they succeeded to take a selfie with deer. For some initial failures, they might feel difficult to become a friend with them, but eventually, all of the players are going to have positive results. Also, I added some jokes and \u00e2\u0080\u009cjust go to sleep\u00e2\u0080\u009d passages for fun.\nFeedbacks&Updates\nFirst feedback is that the overall game\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mood is not well represented. I only had textures and links in my alpha version, so the game itself doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel like interacting with deer. Therefore, I added background pieces of music and many pictures for players to acknowledge situations about each paragraph.\nSecond, for failures and going back to first, many steps are actually unnecessary. For example, If some player failed in the second phase, they had to pass phase 1 to try differently in phase 2. This iterative works made players get bored. Therefore, to remove repeated works players had to be done, I fixed some links between them and grouped contents in passages with an if-else statement to remove redundant works.",

        "description": "Deer would be my inspiration for this game. To be honest, I do not have much experience with deer, growing up, there might be 3 or maybe 4 times where I encounter deer in real life. But in game, many times. There are two variants of deers in games. One, an easy target, practice tool for a beginner. Or the peace lover with enormous power yet only use it to protect the nature/forest it loves dearly. So I went with the second approach.\n\nOverall, this game is pretty much a hero game, well at least the beginning of a hero game. This is just the part where the player starts in bigger games. The main thing I wanted to express in the story, especially toward the end, was that only those who really care for the land are worth to process the power.  There are many choices within the game will lead to bad endings but I believe that is how trials in real life work. Maybe one wrong choice will lead to a bad consequence. Games nowadays will make you the main character as you did some good, blah blah blah. Yet there are no actual procedures where you become the main character. In my game, NO. your action decides where you will go. Be the main character for maybe my next game. Or made the wrong choices and get punished for it",

        "title": "Open Season Beta",
        "description": "Lilliana Rosales: For our final game project, my partner, Omar Reyes, and I created the a shooting game named Open Season. This game is considered a top down shooter game because of the view point of the player, we see the game from an above view. The main character of this game is a young orphaned deer. We drew our inspiration from the well known Disney animated film Bambi. This deer is now seeking revenge for the killing of his beloved family. The deer is killing each hunter one by one until it reaches the main hunter which was responsible for the brutal death of his dear family. The young orphaned deer travels alone from the forest, which is level one, through the highway against traffic, which is level two, all the way to the other forest to find the lead hunter, which is level three. In level one the main goal for the player as the deer is to kill all the hunters before they kill the deer and proceed to the next level. In the second level the goal for the deer is to avoid being hit by the cars coming toward it on the highway and kill at least one the two hunters before they kill you and proceed to the next level. The goal in the third and final level is to kill the hunters which are protecting the main hunter and win the game by killing the main hunter. If the deer can kill the main hunter without having to kill all of the other hunters it can also win. The deer is armed with a pistol and the hunters are armed with a shotgun. If the deer is shot it looses 50 health points per shot. If the deer kills a hunter it can collects 25 health points per hunter. The deer starts off with 600 health points. The hunters have to be shot 3 times in order to die. My partner and I choose this plot because it is so odd and kind of funny. Deers can't shoot people in real life. This game turns the tables of reality.\n\nOur game, Open Season, tries to appeal to the action type of Yee's gamer motivation profiles. Open Season uses guns and chaos which fall under destruction category and also uses action and trill which fall under the excitement category. Open Season can also appeal a small amount to the immersion type due to the plot and interesting character type which fall under the story category and it also bring someone else, somewhere else which is the fantasy category. Because of this, I think Open Season falls under the Action-Social cluster of the three clusters of motivations put together by authors. This is because of the excitement and destruction aspects of the game. Our game is all action playing with no narrative story interruptions. This makes the game a bit harder. As stated in lecture, the more story interruption there is the less difficult the game is. I consider this game to be somewhat difficult because of all the hunters shooting at the deer and the speed of the objects. \n\nI don't think I have ever heard of a game like the one we created. Of course there are many other games which are top view shooter games but not many with a deer as the main shooter. This makes our game unique and appealing. I consider our game to be innovative because of the fact that most if not all games that involve animals and shooting have a person or people shooting the animals, not the other way around like our game does.\n\nIn our first play test, my partner and I were advised that some of the components of our game were a bit too hard to see. We were also told that some of the things were also a bit too fast which then made the game almost impossible to beat. For our next few play tests we were shown that our game needed a few more hard boundary in order for the deer to stay on the main page and be visible to the player. From these play tests we gathered information which helped us improve the game and develop the final game. In the final game we made the bullet which comes from the deer's shot gun a tad larger, slowed down the speed of the bullets coming from the hunters shot gun and provided boulders as boundaries. In addition to these things we also added two additional levels. In these two additional levels we tried to make sure that all of the elements were at an appropriate speed, such as the bullets and the cars on the highway. We also made sure the path in which the deer was expected to take was very much present.\n\nOmar Reyes Cisneros: \n\nThe game my partner, Lilianna Rosales, and I created is a twist on hunting games, dubbed Open Season. Normally, the hunting games that are on the market depict a person hunting animals. With our game we wanted to do something less conventional, and have the people be the hunted for once. We took this idea, and added onto it. It started out as a lonely dear, looking for revenge, but turned into a gun wielding young buck out for blood. We both had a background in video games that involved shooting, so that is how we came up with the shooting aspect of our game. With this in mind we also wanted our game to have an 8-bit gameplay style, that the game Asteroids has. The end result is a top down shooter, where we move our deer around with the arrow keys, and shoot at stationary hunts-people with the spacebar. These hunts people only shoot when you get close enough because they are using shotguns. They think that grouping together will help them take down the meanest deer around, but that won't stop our protagonist from showing them who's boss. We wanted the game to look retro, and have basic controls that anyone can pick up and play. The HUD is very minimal, with only a health bar shown. We didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to make this game about points because it would take away from just having fun. Our game is about having fun and not about achievements. \n\nIn Open Season, we tried to instill some of the player motivation categories mentioned in class and our readings. We went with an immersion and action approach. Given more time and resources we would have made our game have more story involved. We wanted players to live out this fantasy of playing as a deer that was harmed by humankind. Our furry friend, grew sentient and capable, and the ability to use firearms. This is where the action comes in. Initially, we had the idea of giving our deer a full arsenal of weapons to use, but again with time and material constraints we decided to go with the classic pistol loadout. The action aspects embodies the gore and mayhem that is produced by our little deer taking its feelings out on the disrespective hunters. The immersion aspect plays out in the fantastical world we have created for our character to live out. \n\nOpen Season, is innovative in the sense that not many games place you as the animal for the main character. Like I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve explained, in hunting games it's mainly humans that are the hunters and animals that are hunted. As a kid, I played a lot of Cabela\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hunting games, so I drew some inspiration from that game in terms of what kind of game I wanted. Then that also got me thinking about games that I played growing up, like the original Grand Theft Auto. In the original GTA game, we only had a top down view to see the character and our actions. So we drew on these two games for inspiration. We went with a point and shoot mechanic, like in asteroids. Lastly, towards the end of production on Open Season, we found a game that somewhat embodies our game called Deer Avenger. Our game is similar in terms of the protagonist and the shooting aspect, but this game is too vulgar for our taste. Deer Avenger, depicts a deer shooting people who aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hunters, and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no reason to take out your anger on plain civilians. In our game, we are only after those who hurt our furry friends. \n\nDuring the initial playtest of our game, Open Season, we had people explain that it was a little difficult to see and play. The students mentioned that they could not see the bullets of the characters. This made it hard to see the mayhem that is going on. Secondly, they said that it was too hard to play because we had not tuned the character movement. We would accelerate slowly, but then move too quickly and not stop fast enough. We also hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t set hard boundaries for our games, so we easily lost track of the main character. In the beta play throughs we addressed these issues, as well as added more gameplay. During the beta playtest, we had someone mention that we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have an indicator for how they were doing in-game. We explained that we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want a point system and that we just wanted to play and shoot some hunters. Then the player gave us the idea of using a health meter to keep track of how we are doing. We are more worried about surviving than actually shooting all the hunters, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a plus. In the end we were able to produce a fun playable game for us, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all that really mattered.",

        "title": "The curse of the Deer",
        "description": "Our game \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe curse of the Deer\u00e2\u0080\u009d is based on an adventure platformer game. And it has a base story. Therefore, I expected the players understand our story and think about how to solve the problem. This story is about pizza and deer so it can be a new story for the players. Form the story, we make our stages are continuous steps to make pizza. So it is familiar to the players because it is a common one. Everyone knows they should put pizza toppings and bake it. About art things, the first stage is about collecting toppings for the pizza. So we wanted to make items like more realistic to make players feel that they are pizza toppings. And for the second stage, we thought about how to express it as baking. So we use the concept of the oven, and collecting fires to bake it. \n\nFrom the class, we learned that it is important that make what we are interested in, and what we want to make. So, we thought about the main topics for the story at first. And we choose pizza and deer, and thought about the story. It was very fun because we knew many stories related to deer like \u00e2\u0080\u009cAdventure Time\u00e2\u0080\u009d, and make imaginary stories from it. We thought it was crazy to make the game with pizza and deer, but I think it is a success story today. Also, we think about our gameplay style. And I like platformer game style and also rhythm games. So I suggested it and thought about how to apply these things with our topics. Therefore, our game design consisted of this game.\n\nWe thought that it would be more fun if it had multiple endings according to the player\u00e2\u0080\u0099s choice. So, we made the story first, and how to make different endings from the story. It is a very short-time project and the game project is also small, so we thought about how to deliver our stories to the player. Finally, we made pickup items can be the choices for the player. So, in our game, picking items are not the score, they are choices for the endings. \u00c2\u00a0\n\nAlso, we cannot find some assets using pizza and deer at the same time. So we should draw our characters and items. It was hard work, because we should draw most of them, and we are not the artist! But we wanted to give more proper design to the player. So, we draw the main player character looks like a pizza delivery man because our whole story is related to pizza. And also draw deer looks like a vicious king, so that the player can think that it is a villain. I also got feedback from other students, and I think it works well. \u00c2\u00a0\n\n\u00c2\u00a0In this game, the player can be a hero just making a delicious pizza. However, it might be difficult for someone because they should guess deer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s favorite things. I think players feel fun with that. Also, it has 2 stages but different gameplay. And it makes the players have various experiences by playing one game.\n\nAt first, we use different keys for each stage. In the platformer stage, it uses arrow keys to move. But in the oven stages looks like rhythm games, it uses 4 different alphabet keys. We got feedback it is difficult for users, and also we thought it is not good to explain how to play this. So, we modify it to use arrow keys. However, it is too difficult using 4 arrow keys at the same time, so we also modify it to use only 3 keys: up, left, and right.\n\nAt the final testing, I got feedback we had improvement compare with the previous section. And we had some strange mechanics at the first stage. But we had feedback that it was fine because some players feel fun with that. And someone told us it passed too quickly between two stages. So, we changed the portal (oven) smaller, and give instructions to the player to prepare the next stage. Also, it has audio only for 2 stages, so we add some audios for the ending.\n\nWe have some difficulties to implement our design. Because we want to make it be polished, and we have two stages, so they need different events. Our number of events is limited, and we should delete some events for this. I also discussed this in the TA section, but we had a response that we cannot add additional events. So we should delete some features. I think it can be more improved if we can have more events.",

        "title": "Galaxy Birb",
        "description": "My game is called Galaxy Birb. As a player, you are playing as Galaxy Birb, a crying bird that is in dire need of help. There are angry faces chasing after Galaxy Birb and will not stop until they've captured Galaxy Birb.\n\nThe gameplay consists of controlling Galaxy Birb, maneuvering around and dodging the angry faces while also collecting the smiley faces. The smiley faces continuously spawn after you've collected them and will not stop until you've reached the necessary amount needed to call for help. Players are alotted as much time as needed, however, time is not on their side. Angry faces will spawn every 20 seconds and it gets increasingly more difficult the more time passes. Even if the Angry faces miss Galaxy Birb, they always double back and are determined to capture Galaxy Birb.\u00c2\u00a0 The goal wasn't to create a mechanically challenging game, but an emotionally challenging game. Having the standard arrow controls and also having the 8-direction behavior makes mechanics fairly simple. The only challenging mechanic is dodging the angry faces and making sure they do not capture you.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nAesthetically, I wanted the game to be as easy as possible for the players mechanically. The learning process should be fairly easy and learning the game should be the least of their worries. I hope that as the player gets more invested into the game, the game becomes more challenging emotionally.\u00c2\u00a0 After gaining a certain amount of points, the game speeds up altogether and although it is much harder, it doesn't take much more time to complete the game. Frustration should be a normal emotion and hopefully, accomplishment is also an emotion that players feel when finishing my game.\u00c2\u00a0It should feel satisfying to dodge the angry faces, but players are offered very little downtime after dodging and are required to be focused while playing the game to avoid getting caught by the faces. Anxieties may spike when the players reach the speed-up point, especially if players haven't been efficient during their run and there are more than 5 angry faces chasing after Galaxy Birb.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nWith more time and more resources to use, I believe that my game could become one of those \"free-to-play\" games with micro-transactions that could powerup Galaxy Birb as levels progressed or perhaps you could skip levels, earn double points, gain extra lives, etc. Making this game have endless levels, having high scores to beat, maybe add a story mode and the market idea of making Galaxy Birb into a micro-transaction workhorse.\u00c2\u00a0Frustration and investment into the game would hopefully add to the desire to complete the game easier and faster, especially if the player wants to beat their score or a friend's. Of course, there would be people that see how dumb the game is or how pointless it would be, but that temptation of that powerup or that extra life could be enough for certain players. However, this is all hypothetical and my game is still at its simplest stage.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nRather than have a power that could destroy the monsters, the player must play as a crying bird that's only actions are to evade the angry faces and collect smiley faces to be saved. Compared to the shooter games, you, Galaxy Birb, are powerless to fight and must hurry to collect the smiley faces because the more time has passed, the more angry faces that appear. There are no powerups that you can gain and because of that, time is not on your side. Eventually, the player will lose if they are not swift with their movements. It may still be possible to win, but it is astronomically harder to win as the game progresses past a certain time point.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nUnfortunately, I was unable to create an Alpha version of my game for playtesters to play during the time allotted in class. In a sense, the final project that I am submitting is my Alpha version of my game with minimal playtesting. I had a friend playtest my game and they broke the game a couple of times with my failed attempts to introduce a gravity mechanic into the game. There were times where hey said that the monsters were too fast, but it turns out that it was just the acceleration on Galaxy Birb was too slow to be considered a \"scared\" bird. I wanted this game to last longer, however, my friend and I realized that it was near impossible to complete the game with the number of points necessary to win.\u00c2\u00a0",

        "description": "For gameplay, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a traditional STG mixed target defending game. The idea is putting \u00e2\u0080\u009cSpace Invaders\u00e2\u0080\u009d and tower defense game together which is similar to a game called \u00e2\u0080\u009cDefender II\u00e2\u0080\u009d on Android Play Store. The background or target of the game is to defend the village from the endless wave of zombie deer. The only things the player can trust are the wall surrounded the village and the gun he is holding. Nothing is going to help the player protect the village. Once the wall is down, the deer will be so hyper so they will be speeded up until the wall has been rebuilt. As the game is forcing to kill time, my design of the game is the player can stop at any time they want and make it as point-based to create a reference for the player may be for them to compete with others. For the aesthetic goals of the game, since I am not an art person, most of the aesthetic part is from online resources. As this is a mini-game to kill time, I prefer the pixel art style to reduce the complexity of the background to fit the game\u00e2\u0080\u0099s style. Also, I separate the art\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part and the game\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part a bit. Like the Nintendo DS, there are two separate screens. The art\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part is more forcing on the top, and the game\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part is forcing at the bottom to make the game looks as clean as possible. In class, we talked about Legend of Legend and Galaxian, which give me an idea to combine this two. The concept of the game should not be limited to one thing, just like nowadays people are all playing Battle Royale game, we can combine the most current game with one of the oldest game in the history together. Like Hideo Kojima talked about BR game recently: \"The easiest way to make money is to make a game where everyone is on an island trying to shoot each other. I don't want to make that.\" The player should play whatever games they want in their ways. Compare with other STG games, I tried to put the concept of inhibitor in Legend of Legend to an STG game instead of adding fancy weapons or shooting effect as normal STG game. Returning to the simplest STG but putting an element of one the hottest game recently together with my STG game. So for Galaxian and its STG game follower, the developer will usually force on the ways of weapon shooting and the effect of the shooting animations but they always forgot they can extend the gameplay though other ways. So I decided to develop in some other way other than weapons and effects. Also for returning to the simplest STG, I am using two separate part to display the game and the art elements as Nintendo DS instead of common way to display it which most of the STG games are putting everything into one tiny screen with lots of fancy effects which will make the user\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes feel tired easily after a while so sure. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why I want to go back to the simplest way and make it different from the current STG game\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trend. For my final game design, I added some instructions before the player starts playing the game as the grader recommended. I also introduced the elements in the game like the enemies and the constructions to the player as well as their information like HP, respawn time and effect. Besides the instructions, I adjusted the spawn rate and type of enemies to increase the playability. Last but not least, since there\u00e2\u0080\u0099re endless waves of enemies so I added the point system allow the player maybe compete with their friends.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0",

        "description": "On this game, you should move the player to the goal of each stages. The basic storyline as shown below.\n\n\"Soul mates, Aru and Bee, got a mysterious accident. After they woke up, they realized that they are trapped in one body! Only one of them can control the body at the same time, and they found that they should take turns to control the body. There are some places where only Red can go through, and other places where only Blue can go through. Travel this weird world and find an exit from the world!\"\n\n\u00c2\u00a0 As you can expect through the story, you should control and explore the player to specific goal. The controls are done with \"left\", \"right\", \"up\", and \"z\" keys. The first three control keys are done with \"platform\" behavior on Construct 3. \"Left\" key makes the player move left, \"right\" key makes the player move right,\u00c2\u00a0 and \"up\" key makes the player jump. On contract, \"z\" key is a feature for player that changes player's color either red-to-blue or blue-to-red. This part is related to the story that Aru and Bee got trapped in one body changing their body control to themselves.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0 On each stages there are many blocks and items and each of them has special characteristics. The red block and red trampoline are only available to use when the player is blue. Also, the\u00c2\u00a0 blue block and blue trampoline are only available to use when the player is red. Black block and black trampoline are always available for player. If the player meet with any green blocks, the toxic area, player dies and start at the start point. If the player pass the turquoise ring, the portal, it automatically change the player's color.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0 The interesting part is that the block on each stages keep changes their color for each periods. So that the player should focus really hard so that they can maintain their state. This is the feature that makes the games very challenging and hard. Player would consider those features try to reach the goal for each stages. There are 7 stages and at the end of the stage, as an ending story, Aru and Bee are separated to each others.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0 The most characteristic part of this games compared with others is definitely very hard. To reach the final goal, the player would die and restart the stage numerous of times. This would make players mad or stressful and somebody can ask this question,\u00c2\u00a0 \"Why did you made this game?\". My answer is \"Because it's fun\". This can be sound weird but there are many games that makes people much stressful. Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy, cat mario, world hardest game are well-known games for this. People who enjoys games had heard about those games before. Those games makes people's attempt meaningless a lot by making them into initial state, but still people enjoys those games every time. Because those games are really hard to achieve the final goal, it makes the end of the game much worthy. Person who would play this game will also think achieving the final goal is very worthy, and keep try and enjoy the game.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0 My game contains a concept with portal. Portal is well used concept for various ways in games or even other media. Especially, the game PORTAL is very famous for the concept of portal. People can make any characteristics using portal on their imaginary world. For my game, I used as a concept that the turquoise ring, the portal, would change the character's color itself.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0 For the first summit, game players gave us many feedback. Based on this feedback things below has added for the final game.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0 First, we add a tutorial so that people can easily notice for each feature of the blocks and controls. Because we didn't have any explanation before, people had to die a lot to learn for each features. We don't want player to spend their time meaningless so we add the tutorials.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0 Second, we add visual and auditory elements to show when the world change occur. On the first version, the blocks change on certain same period with notification. Due to this, people suffer for super hardness so we imported audio and made background change so that people could notice the time much efficiently.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0 Third, we add more stages and set some save points divides as stage. We want people to enjoy the game longer. This make the world bigger but if there's no any check points people's attempt will be too meaningless. Therefore, additional checkpoints would make people less suffering.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0 Last, we developed our end story much better so that people who reaching the final goal could be more worthy. Some players had dissatisfaction when they end the first version of game. We made more stories and effect receiving peoples demand.",

        "description": "Our graphical game, Traffic Traversal, was a game largely built out of a concept and a mechanic. The gameplay goal of our project was to create a game that felt retro, but had inspiration from modern mobile gaming. The aesthetic of our game was inspired by old retro games, but the gameplay and mechanics are influenced by app games. The retro game that inspired our game\u00e2\u0080\u0099s design was ExciteBike, on the NES. This game inspired Traffic Traversal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side scrolling design and the use of bit-art for the car and roads. The visual style of our game is also influenced by the mobile game Crossy Road, where the design of the road and cars are very similarly low res. Crossy Road also inspired the decision to used cars with primary colors as identifying features.We thought that by merging elements from both games we could make an interesting game that could connect to both audiences. Specifically for gameplay we chose to focus on using drag-and-drop method to move the cars and match them up. The mechanic of dragging and matching was intended to be very familiar to any potential players, since matching is present in many popular mobile games like Candy Crush, and dragging/swiping is present in games like Crossy Road.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nOur game was designed to appeal to players in the Action, and Mastery categories. The game is simple in premise but there is a real challenge to avoiding the never ending onslaught of vehicles. This appeal to Action gamers because they can never let their guard down and relax due to the face paced nature of the game. For Mastery players, there are certain techniques to learn that challenge the player (such as dragging a car over the spawn section for a faster match). In addition, players interested in strategy will no doubt enjoy trying to find the most optimal way to match the cars. The game allows you barely enough time to think ahead and plan and Mastery gamers would enjoy that kind of gameplay.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nOur game is different from the majority of Traffic games in the way that we handle player control. Most traffic games like, Crazy Taxi, have you pilot the main car and avoid traffic by precise movement and control. Our game subverts the traditional tropes of the genre by giving you no control whatsoever over the player car. The entire goal of our game is in fact, the opposite. Control is only given to move the traffic around the player car, and nothing else. The matching elements of our game are not as unique but they offer a fun level of difficulty beyond just ensuring the vehicles don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t collide with your own. One of the games themes is Control, and we made sure to echo the theme in the controls by creating this non-conventional method of movement.\n\nWe received good information on our playtest about overall enjoyment and difficulty. One of the main things we heard back for the early stages of the game is that the matching system was too complex. Initially we had the matching set up to work almost like the game Candy Crush, where you would have to form solid lines of similarly colored cars to get them to clear. We ran into issues when trying that due to confusion from testers. They were generally confused on why it was a traffic game if the main mechanic didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t really echo the aesthetic. This was solved in the version we have now, by only matching pairs of cars as a way to avoid collision. By doing this, we were better able to align the gameplay towards the theme of our game. And additional issue solved by testing was the need for control specifications. Our click-and-drop matching method was inspired by mobile gaming, and works well with mouse and keyboard; however, with testing it was clear that the game is significantly harder using a laptop trackpad. We couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t find a good balance between, since slowing it down made it too easy for mouse and keyboard testers. So we eventually decided to specify that the game should be played with mouse and keyboard.\n\nOverall making Traffic Traversal was a fun and informative process. I learned a lot from contrasting the retro aesthetics with the more modern gameplay mechanics. Class lectures were instrumental in figuring out how to appeal to Action/Mastery players. The idea of subverting expectations was crucial to structuring our game and how it deals with movement and player identity. And with the wealth of information received from testing, we were able to create an enjoyable game.",

Your robots (affectionately called Ruinbas) start off in one of four directions, and you have to place them on the correct start tile to reach the finish tile. Throughout the level are obstacles and color tiles that change your Ruinbas direction, so you have to be careful in where and when you place them. When all robots are on their respective finish tiles you complete the level. ",

        "title": "ZipLine Adventure",
        "description": "The idea for my game was inspired by the part-time job I have working on a zip line course in Felton. I made a \u00e2\u0080\u009cZip Line Adventure\u00e2\u0080\u009d game where the mechanics are similar to a platformer game, but the environment is also moving around the player. Similar to infinitely scrolling games like Flappy Bird or Super Mario, the player is always moving to the right (meanwhile the environment and objects move left). My goal was to use my experience in graphic design to make a simple, clean appearance that is easy on the eyes but feels natural while playing. I wanted the gameplay to be simple, so that you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to worry about special moves or test your memory with additional factors \u00e2\u0080\u0093 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite simple, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fall. On the zip line course where I work, we do all of the clipping and hard work to get the guests connected to the zip line. Although it is extremely unlikely, our guests biggest fear is falling. People tend to overthink \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat do I do next?\u00e2\u0080\u009d on the zip line course, like they have to hold themselves up or apply the brakes themselves or do a complicated routine to zip\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I often tell guests, \u00e2\u0080\u009call you have to do is sit back and look good.\u00e2\u0080\u009d I aimed to mirror two concepts we offer to the guests at my work: simple to operate and aesthetically pleasing.\n\nThis game, like many of the games I played for homework, needs little explanation of what to do and what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the point. As soon as the player moves, the course (including platforms and ziplines) starts moving, pushing the player in the direction they must go. A stopwatch in the top left corner indicates that the player must be attempting to get somewhere based on time. You can jump solely on platforms for the first twenty seconds of the game but will soon find out that you cannot make it across the map without using the zip lines. Once a player makes contact with the zip line (no buttons or actions required) the player zips across at high speed and lands on the other side. It becomes obvious to the player: I need to move right and the zip lines will help. If the player falls, a message appears that the player fell and can restart by pressing \u00e2\u0080\u0098Z\u00e2\u0080\u0099. This way of easing into to the game reminds me of playing \u00e2\u0080\u009cFlorence\u00e2\u0080\u009d on my iPad, where as soon as I asked the question \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhat do I do next?\u00e2\u0080\u009d it became very obvious what the mini game or puzzle that was next was. Most people get \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe point\u00e2\u0080\u009d of this game quickly because the environment moves and forces you right, therefore the person thinks \u00e2\u0080\u009cI must be trying to go to the right.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe difference between this game and other platformer games is the simple mechanics and the inevitable fear of falling. For example, the game Super Mario makes the player avoid certain enemies and gather certain objects. This game doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make the player cautious of avoiding enemies, the only thing to avoid is falling! There is a similar feeling to Super Mario where the player is constantly moving to the right, but there is still the possibility to move backwards and go back to a platform or zip cable that you have passed. One game mechanic to note is the fact that if the player jumps, he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go straight up, but rather is \u00e2\u0080\u009cpushed\u00e2\u0080\u009d slightly to the right. I did not intend for this mechanic, but rather it is a result of the movement of the environment combined with the platform mechanics implemented by Construct 3. I embraced this unexpected mechanic and think of it as another force pushing the player in the right direction. Overall, the feel of the game is similar to games like Flappy Bird, where the player is anticipating the upcoming obstacles by choosing to ascend or descend to safely keep moving rightwards.\n\nThe feedback I received during playtesting was overwhelmingly positive, mainly about how the game looks. I know that I went above and beyond how the game should look to the user but was still thankful that it went appreciated. The TA likened the smooth mechanics to the new Spiderman game where you can swing around from buildings with your spiderwebs, which provides a \u00e2\u0080\u009cfreeing\u00e2\u0080\u009d experience, where it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s simply fun to move. Watching people playtest my game, I realized the mechanics work fine, but the level creation begged more creativity. I saw one person make it halfway across the level without even using a zip line! Therefore, I adjusted the levels so that the player had to ride zip lines because the tree gaps were too large. This turned out to be a \u00e2\u0080\u009cpsychological mechanic\u00e2\u0080\u009d that I used, which is the fact that the player is not sure what platforms and zip cables are coming next. So, I pressed farther into that dynamic by creating a second level which is set at nighttime. I was inspired by the student created game \u00e2\u0080\u009cYami\u00e2\u0080\u009d where the game was pitch black except if you turned the light on you could see, but enemies would charge towards you. I made the appearance of a light, by having a black image cover the whole screen except for a gradient circle around where the player is. This makes the game much more difficult (and spooky) causing the player to feel a bit more anxious jumping into the unknown. I became happy with the easy mechanics of the game, but playtesting is how I learned to set desirable difficulties during the level creation, so that it was just challenging enough to keep the player coming back.",

        "description": "Steve Liu:\n\nThe game\u00e2\u0080\u0099s background would be based on the twine game I designed for earlier. Deer is still the inspiration for this project. Forest become the overall location setting for the game. The main character is the new divine creature of the Foriland, is on a new quest to fight the burning monsters. Those monsters weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t real monsters, they were the citizen of Foriland at one point, yet a wildfire burned them down and they become the monster they are right now looking for revenge. Our divine deer need to find the golden apple let by the previous gods. On the way, he will be stopped by the monsters, yet he will use his leaf bullet to paralyze them until he finds the apple to turn them all back to normal.\n\nThe pixelated games in early game development always impress me. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surprising to see that even with the simplest graphic, you still get playing experience that is as good as lifelike graphics games today. Ever since the first video game, OXO, was published in 1952, game development is rapid. And today, we get games that run on small mobile devices that have amazing graphics. However, the graphics and complex game systems seem to distract players from core mechanics. A game can have a relatively weak graphics performance and still creates a substantial gameplay experience. Our goal, due to the limitations on game design skills, is to create a game with simple graphics and interesting mechanics to engage with. The gameplay is fairly easy. You control a Christmas-styled reindeer, the left-right up-down buttons allow you to maneuver the direction which reindeer is going. You are able to jump on the decks and encounter mounters that can get in your way. Your goal is to reach the golden apple on the left top corner of the room.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nThe concepts that we learned from class brought us some new perspective during the game development. Tom Waits\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Principle about experience states that people like what they like. For example, some players enjoy the achievement of eliminating barriers that get in their way, while others enjoying going around the barriers and eventually get to the trophy. In order to fit this design concept, we gave our players choices in their gameplay. When a monster is spawned, the player can choose to press space key to fire a bullet and eliminate the monster. The player is able to choose another route to go around the monster as well. By designing this path, we hope to give players the game they want to play instead of giving them the game we want them to play. We also make sure that the core mechanic, which is a jump, fits the theme of our game. The background is a pixelated forest art when the player is controlling the character to jump up, it feels like the character is climbing the tree. Also, the double jump mechanic gives a more playable option to players.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nOur game has a lot in common with the famous Doodle Jump. Doodle Jump is a popular game on a mobile device, which has the same core mechanic, controlling the character to reach a higher score (jump higher). Doodle Jump also has monsters that get in your way when playing. In Doodle Jump, the position of the mounters you encounter is presented and will present to you. So you will be able to see the monsters ahead of time and it gives you time to adjust your maneuvers. In comparison, in our game, the monster does not spawn until you reach a certain height. And the spawn trigger points are pretty close to the positions of monsters that it gives you a surprising feeling. Although it is a minor difference, the gameplay feels distinctive. The pop-out monsters give a relatively intensive atmosphere to the game, plus the difficulty using the direction buttons on the keyboard, those give a proper difficulty level to this game.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nDuring the playtest sessions, we got some helpful suggestions for improving the game. One of our players thought the alpha version was too easy that the gameplay time was short. In order to fix this problem, we added the spawn trigger points for monsters and shortened the floating decks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 length. Those changes add more intensity to gameplay, thus prolongs the overall gameplay time. Our playtesters thought the original black background seemed a little boring for the game. Thus, we added a pixelated background art to match the theme of the game. First of all, the pixelated art fits our theme of a retro game, and the forests match our core mechanic which is precise jumping. \n\nJunwen Zheng:\nThe first game to be displayed on a digital screen, OXO, in 1952, started the video game development history. Well-known and classic video games such as Pac Man, Super Mario represent a great success in the early video game development history. Modern games are much more complicated than the early ones, and the graphics are lifelike. Although modern games are able to provide us an immerse gaming experience, the graphics and complex rewards/gameplay systems are distracting us from the pure enjoyment of games. In our opinion, a game can be \u00e2\u0080\u009cempty\u00e2\u0080\u009d graphically but still have a substantial gameplay. For example, snake and pac man are the games that are very easy to maneuver and still gain tons of positive feedbacks. Due to the limitations of our knowledge on game design, we agreed that graphically simple game with easy gameplay is our goal. The gameplay is fairly easy. You control a Christmas-styled reindeer, the left right up down buttons allow you to maneuver the direction which reindeer is going. You are able to jump on the decks and encounter mounters that can get in your way. Your goal is to reach the golden apple on the left top corner of the room.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nWe engaged some of the class concepts in our game design. Tom Waits\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Principle about experience states that people like what they like; you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t force someone to like something. Some players enjoy clearing the barriers that get in their way, some players like to go around the barriers. In our game, players are allowed to choose whether to engage with the monsters that get in their way or not. When a monster is spawned, player can press space key to fire a bullet which will eliminate the monster that get in the way. Play can also choose to go around the monster, and eventually, get to the top. By adding two play styles, we want to give players the experience they want, not ask players to adjust to the preset we are giving them. Also, we want to follow the core mechanics for platformer gamesplay. The jumping mechanic follows our logical order, and the double jump mechanic brings more possibility to the game.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nAfter playing the game several times, you may notice that the game is similar to Doodle Jump, which was fairly popular on mobile devices. Doodle Jump also features a gameplay which your goal is to control your character to get as high as possible. Doodle Jump has monsters as well. However, one major difference between Doodle Jump and our game is the spawn timing for the monsters. In Doodle Jump, the mounters you encounter are there no matter where your character is located. So you will be able to see the monsters ahead of time and it gives you time to adjust your maneuvers. In comparison, in our game, the monster does not spawn until you reach a certain height. And the spawn trigger points are pretty close to the positions of monsters that it gives you a surprise feeling. Although it is a minor difference, but the gameplay feels distinctive. The pop out monsters give a relatively intensive atmosphere to the game, plus the difficulty using the direction buttons on the keyboard, those give a proper difficulty level to this game.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nDuring the play tests, we received some useful suggestions on possible improvements. One of the classmates mentioned that our background, which was black, seemed boring for a game that is supposed to be fun. We later adjusted the background with a pixel art of a forest. The pixelated art fits the overall design of the game, and the trees in the background art indicate the play style of the game: you are climbing something. After adding the background art, the game looks more professional for us. Another useful suggestion we got was about the difficulty level. Playtesters thought that the alpha version was too easy to pass, it was not challenging enough thus caused an insufficient gameplay time. In response to that, we first shortened the length of floating decks to increase difficulty level. And we added the specific spawn trigger points for the monsters as I mentioned earlier. Those changes give more playability and increase the playtime.",

        "title": "Hungry Slime",
        "description": "The theme for this game is falling, so everything goes around this word. Originally we were just designing a game that is directly related to this theme. We want our players experience the anxiety of falling. So for our final product, Hungry Slime, is an intense game that firefly related to falling\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094our player need to survive under the intense apple fall. The apple randomly spawned not only at the top of the screen, but also at some middle of the air. We decided to do so because it adds more randoms to the player, as they might be scared by the suddenly spawned apple\u00c2\u00a0 in the middle air. Such can create an intense game play environment. Also we feel the need to add a reward system for players, since we discovered that this game might be fairly hard for some players to sustain a longer period of time. So we added water drop in our game to extend their play time. We also find spawn random mushroom can help us move our player from staying at a fixed point. We found that if player moves more intensively, they can feel the anxiety more, so the idea of spawn another thing rather than raindrop is fairly good idea to me. At the beginning of our game development process for our game is painful, as we are a three people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s group. Some would say that having more people is much easier because you can have an extra member in constructing game.during the alpha phase, three of us are all making games that seeks relationship with falling. For my game Mr.Bullet, I made it a shooting game, which player can shoot bullets bounce off the wall and finally hit the enemy. For that alpha game, now I consider that more like a physics puzzle game. I came to discover the core mechanics of the game is not that related to falling. In that game, players control their mouse as the direction of the agent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gun. After clicking the left mouse, a bullet will be released and will fly following the law of physics.I can insist that bullet flying can be interpreted as falling, but for most people, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think them could agree on that. So we gave up my idea and decided to work on what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s final game, idea from Yixin Liang. Overall her game has significantly more relationship with our theme.\u00c2\u00a0\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2The first thing I think about is our game is theme generated. As we learned from class, there are two kinds of game, which are mechanical generated and theme generated. For me, mechanic generated game appears harder, because it relies more on an idea which can change usual gameplay into a completely different, exotic experience for players. So we changed our game to theme based, and focused on our theme word \u00e2\u0080\u009cfall\u00e2\u0080\u009d. The other key term we thought of as we were designing the game is the Ludic Loop. Because we believe our game is relatively simple compared to most of other games. If that game is easy, players might quickly lose the desire to play more of it. This thinking forced us to design a game that is not a flow. On the other hand, flappy bird is a good example of a simple game employing ludic loop. Many people were obsessed with how hard flappy bird. They like how challenging it is and easily forget that is a fairly simple game. It cannot be denied that some 3A games also employs Ludic Loop, like Diabolo and Senior: Die Twice, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more effective for a small game to catch its player for a longer time if it employs ludic loop.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2To me, what makes this game special is that it incorporates vertical jumps to several platforms in different heights. For games that resembles ours, there usually just one ground platform for players to move their character. Player just move left or right to avoid falling object. As we add more platforms, there are more strategies for players to experience. To attract our player to jump on those platforms, we spawn mushrooms and give player point reward for picking up mushroom, so it should be good.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2During our first play test, mushroom is the main issue to consider. At the beginning our mushroom were just spawning in the center. Testers says this will greatly decrease our game\u00e2\u0080\u0099s playability, so we worked to fix that and let our mushroom spawns randomly. Later as we were playing by ourselves, we found that every time we restart our game, the health bar won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go back to full. It stays the same at where it were during the last game, so we fixed that by adding more conditions to health bar. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the two main issue we encountered during our play tests.",

        "description": "In creating my game I had a few gameplay goals that I wanted to achieve. The first one was making the game difficult but not making is so difficult that the player would want to quit. I achieved this by playtesting it with multiple people and seeing if they could beat it or not. When it was difficult for them I would increase the number of lives they had and see if they did better until I found an average amoung players that I could use. The way I would determine if it was too difficult or not was based on how many times the player would die in the game. I wanted the player to experience a death a few times in the game and also wanted them to progress at a reasonable pace. Another goal we had was to make this game multiplayer. To achieve this goal we had to map the different player keys to one keyboard. Going into this project I didn't have much of an aesthetic design goal but by the end, I made it clear. I started out by wanting everything to be just plain pixel art, something that I could easily draw and possibly fit a goal. When I made the first sketch of my drawings they had almost this rustic feel to them so I adopted that style for the rest of them, making them both simplistic pixel art and rustic at the same time. I also chose to make the walls in my game solid black because I felt that they fit with the theme and they stood out among the chaos. Another element that I chose to add was to make the players and enemies more detailed compared to other elements in the game. It helps the player Identify who they are and who the enemy is.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\nOne in-class concept that I used was the gameplay story balance. Our game is heavily focused on the gameplay rather than a story. The story is mainly what the players can interpret from each level. Another in-class concept that we used hyperlinks. Whenever the two players reach there destination the game switches to the next level. It continues to do this until the game has been beaten. Another thing that we did that was discussed in class was buff and nerf different aspects of our game until we found the right balance. These things included how many times the enemy tank could fire per second, how many times the player tank could fire per second, how many times the turret could fire per second, how many lives the player had, how many turrets were there, how many tanks were there, and the number of power-up in each map. We would assess most of this stuff based on how the player would respond to it in the game and how well the player would overcome or use these different aspects of our game\n\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\nOne innovative thing that we put in our game was the multiplayer feature. I did this by mapping two sets of controls to one keyboard. We wanted the player to have to communicate with his partner in making most of the in-game decisions. We didn't want the game to feel like most other multiplayer games where the players are pitted against each other, not required to communicate or long distances away from each other. Another innovative thing that we did in our game was to create an instructions section. This helped the players understand the controls in our game and what the power-ups do before they even start playing the game.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0\n\nWe responded to the playtesting feedback in a number of different ways. Most people when starting out the game did not know the controls or what any of the power-ups did in the game, so we started out by adding an instructions page to our game. We also adjusted the number of lives each player got at the end of our feedback to make it more balanced. We also made the bullets different colors to distinguish the player bullets from the enemy bullets because when we first started out you couldn't tell if the oncoming bullets would damage you or not. We also adjusted the tank's speed in the game to make them slower. This was a result of some players rushing to the end of the levels while dodging all of the bullets. By slowing it down just a little bit the players were no longer able to dodge the bullets.",

In the Rapunzel fairy tale, I got an idea from the situation where Rapunzel was trapped by a witch and Rapunzel was running away from the tower. Our game is a game depicting the process of Rapunzel being trapped at the top of the tower and escaping the tower. The game consists of three stages, and each time you move on to the next stage, the difficulty will rise. Gameplay will proceed using the left, right, and up arrow keys. The left and right arrow keys create an action that moves the Rapunzel to the left and right respectively. Up arrow key is used to jump Rapunzel. The game starts at the top. The character then has to descend to the bottom while avoiding obstacles and stepping on the right path. When the character passes through the door at the bottom, the game is cleared.\n\nThe aesthetic goal of our game was a challenge. Our game has two difficulty levels. Easy mode and difficult mode can be selected. Game players can improve their understanding and skills in games through easy mode. In difficult mode, players challenge the game and master the game. Also, the stage of the game was divided into three stages. Each time you move to the next stage, new obstacles are added that interfere with the player, and the difficulty level of the game is increased by adjusting the position of the obstacle and the position of the footstep.\n\nOur game includes the concept of abstraction, game-story, and difficulty. When I first built the game, I planned to make a dot game. I did not have the tools and the time to make a real Rapunzel. However, even if it was produced as a dot game, I made some details to make the characters and obstacles in the game have symbolic meaning. I made Rapunzel's character by expressing Rapunzel's long hair and beautiful blonde. I made a character symbolizing bee by expressing the bee's spit and bee's pattern. In the case of the spider, I made it a spider by describing the movement of the spider up and down.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0 Because the aesthetic goal of our game is a challenge, we have designed the game so that the game's weight becomes larger than the story, because the control of the player has to be the mainstay of the game. The concept of the game is Rapunzel, I added a description of the game concept to the game-opening, which made the player more immersed in the game. And the part that is not fully explained in the opening was recognized as Rapunzel through game character and background image.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0 And the playtest feedback I received when I first made the game was that the game was too difficult. Since the aesthetic goal of the game is a challenge, I did not try to control the difficulty. However, the game is so difficult that the player may lose interest, allowing the player to control the difficulty of the game. Easy difficulty games have eliminated the ability of the crystal, which is the main obstacle in the game, to make the game easier for the player.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0 There are two main differences between our game and other platform games. One is that the progress of the game progresses from top to bottom and the speed of the drop is limited. Platform games often go from left to right. However, we decided to go from top to bottom to match the concept of escaping from the top. And other platform games did not limit the speed of the drop. Our game was going from top to bottom, so we needed a new limit. Otherwise, the game was cleared too easily. It was to limit the speed of the drop. By limiting the dropping speed, we were able to increase the level of difficulty of the game, and we were able to construct the originality of our game only.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0 I tried to make the game difficult as I can when I first built the game. However, I received feedback that the game was too difficult in the gameplay test, and the game was so difficult that I had to quit the game because players cannot proceed to next the stage. So, I decided to choose the game difficulty level. So I made the first game in hard mode, and I created the Easy mode by removing the influence of crystal in the first game.\n\n\u00c2\u00a0",

All endings have meanings, but true ending is meant to be hard and go through repetitive steps, for users who like the game can have longer experience and in each loop different flashbacks could be visited so covers the entire story.\nAfter all these steps, I wanted user to feel katharsis  from how the deer actually played a role and what deer actually was to me.\n",

        "description": "Game Mechanics: Direction Keys to control player car left move right, right move right, and up is a jump. \"R\" key is restart. Clicking left mouse button to navigate on the menu.\nItems: Red Heart for HP up, Star for invisible. \nResource: Survive Time and Score. You as the player car need to avoid the traffic blue car to collect Star. Touching blue cars will damage you 1 heart. After you get the start, you will have 5 second invisible time to kill blue car for scores. \nGameplay Genre: 2-D platform Game. \nTheme: Make the traffic. You hate traffic and want to destroy all the cars.\nLiterary Genre: Destruction makes people happy! \nGoal: Let people gain excitement when they can destroy cars and gain as many points as possible.  \n\nWhen we start to create this graphical game, I started with the theme in mind. How traffic in the real world can relate with gameplay and let the player enjoy? I start to think about why people hate traffic. People hate traffic because they can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t move and must be stuck inside the line. To provide people solution to release their pressure in the real world, I create my gameplay mechanism which player as an angry driver can destroy cars in front of their car. However, an invincible car won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t provide the gamer any challenge when playing the game. I need to make the game harder which player car can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t destroy other enemy cars until they collect the invincible star item. I also add more enemy types, like enemy car and enemy bus, to the world, and the linear world map which player car need some time to drive to the end. The enemies and items will randomly spawn through the world which player will discover different each time they play the game. In the end, I made the game world into an infinite loop which player can continue playing the game until they die. All these add up to the gameplay, which makes gameplay more diverse and longer. The aesthetic goal of this game is to provide people fun about the concept without thinking about the real world. We adapt 2d art which makes this game more accessible to people of all age because we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want people to start playing our game and felt bad about those cars they destroyed. At the same time, the art needs to be recognized as car, road, sky or building.\n\nI learned a lot from this class about the concept and theories of game design, and I also tried to utilize some of them inside this game. For example, we tunning the control of the player car a lot to make it feel good to play. I learned that like the star war game inside the lecture, the player control needs to be good enough so that people wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t frustrate about the game control and lose connection with the in-game character. Besides, to add up the player connected to the player car, I add three lines of back story at the start of the game. These three lines of text send the message to the player that the player car is the angry driver to control. This class also teach us to be a great playtester. When we think we have finished the game, we will playtest the game again and again. We always found some bugs here and there which hard to find if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t play the game. Last but not least, this class teach me about the resource and loop player can get. We create Heart and Invicinble star as in-game items for the player car to live longer and destroy more car. When you destroy the enemy car, you also will get scores to add on to the center of the screen. All these looping systems from HP and Stars into scores and survive time give players a goal to achieve in this game.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nDifferent than other platformer game, like Mario, our game only has one platform. In this platform, the player needs shifts between surviving and attacking stages constantly. Player need to survive in the rush of cars until they find the invincible star to attack back. Other than games like Mario, our game didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have a goal to reach in the end. The game provides and constant changing loop which player needs to survive as long as possible. This combination of gameplay mechanism is novel which I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see in other games.\n\nAccording to many playtesting from different people, we correct our game a lot. From the alpha playtest, our peer played the game and think the control is lacking, which the player car can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t jump high enough and the car shift too much when turning. To fix the first problem, we tunning control by changing the jump strength and gravity. This makes the control felt more smooth and responsive. For the second one, we change the center of the turning to the player car sprit. Now, when the player turns left or right, the player car will shift at the same place. Form TA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grading comments which the background is too bright to distinguish the items from it. We change the whole background into lighter and darker than before. Then we bring up the items sprits contrast and brightness to the max. This makes the items pop out from the background which let player more easy to see. From our own playtest, we discover lots of problems when we playing the game instead of looking at the code itself. For example, survive time won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop when you game over. After we correct the mistake and play the game again, survive time will stop forever when you die once. We finally solve this problem through many playtest. The playtest and tunning is helpful and need before you ship your game.\n\nTo conclude, the process of making this graphical game make use of them in class knowledge and bring my game making skill into the next level. I appreciate the time I spend in making this game and tunning it into the final version.",

To incorporate the theme of traffic, the initial situation of the game in the player stuck in bumper to bumper misery. And to incorporate the theme of soulmates, I tried to weave the theme  into almost all of the conclusions of my twine game. Something I really wanted the player to feel was the vast difference in outcomes small decisions had. A simple music choice would determine whether or not the player could get arrested or end up in the hospital. Hopefully I succeeded in this. To sum up the game in three words: Traffic, Love, and Butterflies. Butterflies because of the butterfly effect, or how minuscule choices have earth shattering differences in outcomes.",

        "description": "The theme I chose is \"falling.\" My whole game is about a person trying to suicide by jumping off a building. Well, you don't necessarily need to fall based on your choices, but falling is like a concept and a kind of endings in my game. In this game, I want players to feel that they are not just making choices for a person, but they are the person standing on the roof. I use the words \"you/your\" a lot because of that. Also, I don't want the players to be too upset while playing this game. So, I intentionally wrote a lot of words in a cold, emotionless tone. \"Everything happens, but you only want to die.\" I forced players to accept all the information so that they feel less awkward and more natural to think in the way I provide. Moreover, I don't think my character should be emotional. I think it works pretty well with some funny joking words or choices I put in there.",

        "title": "Down the Rabbit Hole BETA",
        "description": "The main gameplay goal is a game with high replayability and simple controls, somewhat similar to the classic arcade games. This game has similar classic air combat games. That is, the player has to evade every bullet (for this case, every teacup) and survive as much as you can. With several innovative difference, which will be described in a later paragraph, this is a typical arcade game, so high replay-ability of replay is quite achieved in considerable degree. And there are only two kinds of keys, which are using items and moving horizontally. And there can be only 3 positions that players can place. So simple control is also achieved.The main aesthetic goal is to achieve strong cohesion between theme and gameplay. Our theme is \u00e2\u0080\u0098Alice in the Wonderland\u00e2\u0080\u0099, more specifically the falling scene when Alice enters the rabbit hole. This falling theme is not only closely related to the gameplay mechanics but also the theme word we provided from the lecture. Artworks are carefully chosen to represent the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Alice in the wonderland\u00e2\u0080\u0099 theme. Rabbit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clock, the \u00e2\u0080\u0098Drinkme\u00e2\u0080\u0099 potion, Ace of Heart and the teacups are all directly related to the important imageries of the story. Even the game music, which is not composed by ourselves, is sharing the same theme of us. Except for Alice\u00e2\u0080\u0099s explosion at the end, all of the details are closely linked to the theme. So we think our aesthetic goal is achieved.As we learned from the lecture, the decision is what makes a game interesting. If there are too many decisions to make at one time, it makes players confused. But if there are too few options for the decision, it will make a game boring. At first sight, it seems that our game is a simple no-brainer dexterity game. That is not true. The Ace of Heart cards, which can eliminate upcoming teacups, are the most common items in the game. You can use this item right away, or keep it till the stage becomes much harder. This makes the players make a choice and strategy. Also, there is another kind of decision there. If players collide to the rabbit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clock, it will grant 50 points, which is five times of normal teacup breaking points. However, the rabbit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clock reverses the direction of teacup for 2 seconds and reverse again. During this time, the movement pattern of teacups is confusing. So it is likely to kill player because of it. A player can choose between to raise a score by going through a risky way or to choose a safe way by giving extra points away. This choice happens periodically. This is why this game is really addictive. I guess this is also related to the operant conditioning, which was covered in the lecture.We tried to design a fresh game with some innovative features. Actually, we are not deep into the air combat game, which is perhaps the most similar kind of game to ours. Our ignorance liberated us from the genre\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cliche and encouraged us to make peculiar features. For example, there is no enemy to fight against here. Instead of making an enemy to conquer, we just throw players in infinite teacup rain. Furthermore, we give users a limited power for active shooting. This decision is mainly due to the theme we implemented and the limitation of a number of total events. And we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think that kind of enemy is really necessary here. Big differences to relatives but a satisfying one. The time-traveling rabbit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clock and 'Drinkme' potion, which temporarily reduces the size of Alice, is also unique items in this game. One of the most important innovations in our game is a strongly convincing theme of items. In combat games, items look like military supplies which are quite general and boring. In our game, we used game items from the original story so that we can understand what will happen if we use those items even before we really play it. We reflected several feedbacks from playtesters in our final beta version. One of the most important change is the UI. Before the beta version, we try to explain every important rule using plain texts. But after we got the feedback, we realize an image base description will improve UI and the player\u00e2\u0080\u0099s understanding of the game. Some feedbacks are really critical to the gameplay. Every velocity in the game, including falling of Alice, speed of cups and items, and even speed of background is half as slow when we first built the alpha version. This version can easily lose tension and even harder for it has non-intuitive timing. This problem was also discussed feedback so we fixed it.'",

        "description": "What I made for the Twine game is an educational game that helps to learn UCSC Traffic. Since I am visiting student from South Korea for this summer session, I didn't know how to take public transportations. When I first came to UC Santa Cruz, the global leaders help us to talk buses, for example, students can take bus free except 17, there is a jump bike or the direction to go to downtown. This motivates me to make this \"UCSC Traffic Center for Visitors\" game.\nThe game contains seven stages and three hidden stages. There is one big game story penetrating all the stages, which is, \"you are a visiting student from South Korea who doesn't know the traffic very well, and you want to learn how to take transportation\" just like me! Also, there is a score on the control board, which is increased if you correct the answer. The stages are categorized into three sections, \"inside\", \"downtown\", and \"san Jose\" sections. At the last stage in each section, you will enter the hidden stage if your score is too low to pass. These hidden stages provide additional problems for each section.\nYou can find \"Hall of Fame\" and \"Hall of Shame\" at the end of the game. It is revealed if you got 7 and 0, respectively. Unfortunately, I couldn't make a ranking board, but I think it will be great if it is in the Hall of Fame.\nI hope this game may help other visiting students who are the first to the UC Santa Cruz. Every summer, there will be many Korean students just like me! I really hope they can easily learn the traffic, and freely use them to travel to this beautiful city and university.",

        "description": "When initially coming up for the concept of the game, it was clear there were some severe limitations on the amount of mechanical complexity we could fit into the game as well as some slight graphical limitations. Navigating through the constraints of theme, minimal mechanical complexity, and a deadline really encouraged a great amount of creativity in the design process. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a window into the development of the gameplay and aesthetic goals of \u00e2\u0080\u009cDeerly Beloved\u00e2\u0080\u009d:\u00c2\u00a0\n\nTheme: Right off the bat, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDeer\u00e2\u0080\u009d as the theme word intrigued me as I had already explored both \u00e2\u0080\u009cTraffic\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cSoulmate\u00e2\u0080\u009d in my Twine Game. It seemed as though it would be less explored by other students, so it might be an opportunity to be innovative or at least different. Once the theme word was chosen, the rest of the theme and concept came naturally. The player would control a deer. What do deer do in the wild? Survive. So survival would be our theme.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nGameplay: With survival as the theme, two core mechanics came to mind; needs management and danger aversion. Maybe there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a better term for it, but by needs management I mean managing thirst, hunger, sickness... etc. Danger aversion is pretty self explanatory. My favorite survival game, Minecraft, employs both of these very well. Hunger and Health serve as the needs that need to be managed, and enemies must be avoided, at least initially. In our game, we decided that Hunger would be a good need to manage and danger in the form of hunters wielding guns would be a good threat to avoid. Because both of these mechanics need to be executed simultaneously, the player has to perform a sort of juggling act, transferring between the states of collecting food and avoiding projectiles. If the player focuses only on one, they risk falling victim to the other responsibility. I think it is a simple yet compelling gameplay loop. We chose to quantify the success of the player through a score. This was to give the player an external motivation to continue surviving. In addition we added a 1 up system in which a player can earn an extra life in the form of a fawn, who is willing to take a bullet for the player. This was an attempt to add a little more emotional potency to the game, but by the time the player\u00e2\u0080\u0099s score hits triple digits the stage is most likely already littered in baby deer and doe corpses. Maybe now it serves more as a criticism of the exploitation of wildlife.\u00c2\u00a0By choosing to utilize some conventions of classic survival games, as well as implementing several other features, hopefully we succeeded in creating a compelling and innovative gameplay experience.\n\nAesthetic: Given the somewhat limited graphical capabilities of Construct 3 and it's good presentation of pixelated art styles, a retro pixel art seemed only natural. It also helped that I was a bit obsessed with making pixelated versions of my favorite TV show characters in early high school, so I had a bit of experience going in. Since I made both the textures and sounds for the game, I wanted them to be stylistically consistent. This meant the hard edges of the textures would have to be translated to audio, aka chiptune. I used a really great in-browser music making software called beepbox.co to compose the music and create several other sound assets for the game. Through the use of pixelated textures and bit reduced audio, I think we succeeded in creating a retro pixel art aesthetic.\n\nGoals: To sum it up more concisely, our goal was to create a lofi and nostalgia evoking aesthetic experience, while creating an intriguing gameplay loop to encourage players to rack up high scores.\n\nProblems & Solutions: Through several playtesting sessions with classmates, we got some valuable feedback and insights into the reception of \u00e2\u0080\u009cDeerly Beloved\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Luckily there was no evil data to speak of, just very awesome, supportive, and informative (awesuppormative) classmates. One instance of this feedback was the initial placement and lack of movement of the hunter enemies. They would sit stationary in the four corners of the stage, endlessly firing at you. This was a bit difficult for some, especially considering the near invisible bullets. In turn, we changed the hunter placement, added movement and increased visibility of the bullets. Many times however, I did stick with Looney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advice that you are your greatest critic.\u00c2\u00a0\n\nFin: In the end, creating \u00e2\u0080\u009cDeerly Beloved\u00e2\u0080\u009d with Sheng was a great opportunity to learn more about game design, art, and people.",

The mission for this game was to create a Movement-Based Game with an alternative/expansive use of logic through a fantasy-based set of ideas. We created a game that uses a fictional character, Elf, to represent the ideals of goals and responsibilities everyone has in life. However, everyone also is surrounded by good influencers and bad influencers. Therefore, Dryadalis represents why it is important to keep accepting help from good influencers and fight bad ones away. The player will have the control to move the Elf away/towards danger while also fighting back.",
